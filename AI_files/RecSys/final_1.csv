0,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords such as ""portfolio creation,"" ""big data,"" ""AI,"" ""trainee recruitment,"" and ""AI education."" However, the user's announcement search history indicates they have primarily searched for keywords related to employment (8 times) and education (6 times). 

While there are overlaps in the general theme of education, none of the specific keywords present in the user's search history directly correspond to the new announcement's keywords. The user has shown a significant interest in employment and educational topics, but the new announcement focuses more on AI and big data, which may not align closely with the user's documented interests. 

Given that there is no specific interest in keywords like ""portfolio creation"" or ""AI education"" reflected in the user's search history, it is reasonable to conclude that the user does not have a strong interest in this new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 0 indicates a lack of interest in the new information provided.",0
1,"Based on the given information, the user's search history shows they have searched for the keyword ""education"" 23 times, ""lecture"" 18 times, and ""free education"" 9 times. The new announcement's keywords are ""education"" and ""game."" Given that the user has shown a significant interest in ""education"" through their search frequency, it is logical to conclude that they are likely interested in the new announcement, particularly due to the presence of the keyword ""education."" However, the keyword ""game"" has not appeared in their search history, indicating that they might not have any interest in that particular aspect. Overall, the high frequency of searches related to ""education"" suggests that the user is likely to have an interest in the new announcement, leading to the target score of 1.",1
2,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for keywords related to employment (17 times), education (14 times), employment support (8 times), boot camp (6 times), and curriculum (5 times). However, the new announcement's keywords are ""planning"" and ""contest."" 

Given that there are no overlapping keywords between the user's search history and the new announcement, it seems that the user may not have a specific interest in this announcement. The absence of relevant searches indicates a lack of engagement. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not likely to be interested in the new announcement, aligning with the target score of 0.",0
3,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history includes 28 searches related to ""meeting"" and 22 searches related to ""supporters."" The new notice contains keywords such as ""club,"" ""meeting,"" ""volunteer,"" and ""recruitment."" 

Considering the user's significant interest in ""meeting,"" as shown by the 28 searches, it indicates a strong inclination towards that particular keyword. Although ""club,"" ""volunteer,"" and ""recruitment"" have not been specifically searched by the user, the high frequency of searches for ""meeting"" suggests that the user is likely to find the new notice relevant due to the overlap with their interest.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the user potentially has an interest in the new notice, leading to a target score of 1.",1
4,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Scholarship"" and ""Graduate Student."" The user's search history shows that they searched for ""Graduate Student"" 21 times and ""Scholarship"" 17 times. Since the user has shown significant interest in both keywords by searching for ""Graduate Student"" and ""Scholarship"" multiple times, it can be inferred that they are likely interested in the new announcement. Thus, the target score of 1 indicates that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement.",1
5,"Based on the given information, the user's ""target score"" is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new announcement.

However, the user's search history reveals a focus on various topics, including ""Academy,"" ""Education,"" ""Poster,"" and ""Backend,"" with significant searches for ""Academy"" (5 times), ""Education"" (4 times), and ""Poster"" (4 times), among others.

There is no alignment between the user's search history and the keyword of the new announcement. The absence of any searches related to ""student engagement"" suggests that the user does not have a strong interest in this specific area. Therefore, it appears that the user is unlikely to be interested in this announcement, which correlates with the target score of 0.",0
6,"Based on the given information, the user's ""goal score"" is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new announcement. The keyword tags for the new announcement are ""Other,"" ""Government Support,"" and ""Job Preparation.""

Since none of the user's searched tags align with the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user does not have a specific interest in ""Other,"" ""Government Support,"" or ""Job Preparation."" The absence of relevant keyword searches further supports the conclusion that the user's interest in this announcement is likely very low, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

Since none of the keywords from the new announcement align with the user's recent search history, it suggests that the user is unlikely to have any interest in the announcement. The absence of searches related to ""contest"" or ""design"" further reinforces the idea that the user has not shown any inclination towards this new information. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the user does not find the announcement relevant based on their prior search behavior.",0
8,"Based on the given information, the user has not shown any interest in the newly announced notice since the target score is 0.

However, the user's search history shows a significant focus on other topics: ""course registration"" 18 times, ""image"" 13 times, ""precautions"" 10 times, and ""security"" 9 times. None of the tags from the user's search history align with the new notice's keywords. This indicates that the user is likely uninterested in the new notice, as there is no overlap with their recent searches.",0
9,"Based on the given information, the new notice includes the keywords ""employment support,"" ""bootcamp,"" and ""backend."" However, the user's recent search history indicates that they have shown interest primarily in volunteer work (9 times), gatherings (6 times), and clubs (6 times), among other tags. Notably, there are no searches related to ""employment support,"" ""bootcamp,"" or ""backend,"" suggesting that these topics do not resonate with the user. Therefore, since the user has not expressed interest in these specific keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely not interested in the new notice, which aligns with the provided target score of 0.",0
10,"Based on the given information, the user's keyword search records indicate that they have searched for ""AI"" 15 times, ""Big Data"" 4 times, ""Blockchain"" 8 times, and other related tags multiple times. The new announcement's keywords are ""AI"" and ""Big Data."" The user has shown significant interest in ""AI"" with 15 searches, suggesting a strong inclination towards this topic. Additionally, although ""Big Data"" only appears 4 times in the search history, the user still has some level of interest in it. 

Since the user has repeatedly searched for the key term ""AI,"" it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely very interested in the new announcement, as it directly connects with their interests. Therefore, the user likely has an interest in the new announcement, supporting the target score of 1 (indicating interest).",1
11,"Based on the given information, the user's ""notification search history"" shows that they have searched for the keyword tags ""contest"" 16 times, ""education"" 15 times, ""eligibility"" 11 times, and ""seminar"" 8 times. The new notification keywords are ""contest"" and ""design."" 

Since the user has a high frequency of searches related to ""contest"" (16 times), it suggests a strong interest in this area. However, the keyword ""design"" has not been mentioned in the user's search history at all, leaving it uncertain whether the user has interest in that aspect. 

Thus, considering the substantial interest in ""contest"" and the complete absence of ""design,"" it can be concluded that the user is likely interested in the new notification, specifically the ""contest"" aspect, which aligns with their previous searches. Therefore, the target rating is 1, indicating the user has interest in the new notification.",1
12,"Based on the given information, the user's ""target score"" is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new announcement. The keyword information for the new announcement includes ""planning"" and ""contest."" However, the user's search history reveals no instances of these keywords, as they have focused on other areas such as ""employment preparation,"" ""web development,"" and ""volunteering.""

The user's search records suggest a strong interest in various activities related to their current pursuits, but there is no alignment with the announced keywords. This lack of connection implies that the user is likely not interested in the announcement. Therefore, the target score reflects the user's disinterest in the provided keywords.",0
13,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keyword tags ""target audience,"" ""contest,"" and ""UCC."" However, the user's search history reveals a focus on the following tags: ""contest"" (13 times), ""essay"" (11 times), ""game"" (10 times), ""supporters"" (7 times), ""planning"" (5 times), and ""poster"" (4 times).

Even though the user has shown a strong interest in the ""contest"" tag, which directly corresponds to one of the new notice's keywords, the other tags in the new notice—""target audience"" and ""UCC""—were not present in the user's search records. This indicates a possible interest in the new notice based on their strong engagement with the ""contest"" tag, but the lack of related searches for the other keywords adds a level of uncertainty.

Given that the user has engaged with the ""contest"" keyword significantly, it suggests that they might be interested in the new notice. However, since the other keywords do not appear in their search history, it ultimately leans toward a conclusion that the user may not fully connect with the new notice as a whole, leading to a 0 as the target score for interest in this new notice.",0
14,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows significant engagement with keywords related to ""event"" (10 times), ""marketing"" (9 times), ""Ministry of Employment and Labor"" (8 times), ""education"" (8 times), ""employment"" (8 times), and ""internship"" (7 times). The new announcement contains keywords such as ""employment,"" ""job preparation,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" ""startup,"" and ""internship.""

Considering that the user's search history reflects a strong focus on keywords like ""employment"" and ""internship,"" which correspond with the new announcement keywords, it's likely that the user is interested in the new notice. The presence of the ""education"" keyword in both the new announcement and the user's search history further supports this notion. Therefore, it can be concluded that the user is likely to have an interest in the new announcement, thus resulting in a target score of 1.",1
15,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""Game,"" ""Contest,"" and ""Essay."" The user's search history shows the following keyword tags: ""Contest"" (18 times), ""UCC"" (11 times), ""Essay"" (7 times), ""Submission Period"" (6 times), ""Credit Exchange"" (4 times), and ""Current Students"" (4 times).

The user has frequently searched for the keyword ""Contest,"" indicating a strong interest in this area, especially since it appears 18 times in their search history. Additionally, the keyword ""Essay"" was searched 7 times, which also shows some level of interest. Although the user has not shown any interest in the keyword ""Game,"" the significant interest in ""Contest"" suggests they are likely to be engaged with the notice. 

Thus, given the prominence of the relevant keywords within the user's search history, it is logical to conclude that the user is interested in the new notice, leading to a target score of 1.",1
16,"Based on the given information, the user has a goal score of 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement. The new announcement's keywords include ""Supporters,"" ""Recruitment of Supporters,"" ""Press Corps,"" and ""Content Creation."" However, the user's recent search history shows a strong focus on different topics: ""Cloud"" (12 times), ""Security"" (8 times), ""Job Support"" (7 times), ""Free Education"" (6 times), ""Backend"" (6 times), ""Frontend"" (6 times), and ""Server"" (5 times). 

There is no overlap between the searched keywords and the new announcement's keywords. The user has not expressed any interest in the topics related to the new announcement, as none of the searched tags are related to the announcement's content. Since the user’s interests do not show any relevance to the new announcement, it logically suggests that they are unlikely to be interested in it, leading to the conclusion of a score of 0.",0
17,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a considerable interest in the keyword ""Supporters"" (서포터즈), as evidenced by their search history. Specifically, they searched for ""Supporters"" 4 times, which indicates some level of interest. However, it is important to note that although the frequency of searches is not exceedingly high, it does suggest that the user is at least somewhat engaged with topics related to ""Supporters.""

In contrast, the new notice's keyword is exclusively ""Supporters."" Given that the user has searched for this keyword multiple times (4 times), it is reasonable to infer that they may indeed have an interest in the new notice. Therefore, the rationale leads to a conclusion that there is a likelihood the user is interested in the announcement.

Thus, based on the mentioned data, the target score could be interpreted as 1, indicating that the user is likely to be interested in the announcement.",0
18,"Based on the given information, the user's search history includes the following tags: AI (6 times), supporter program (4 times), competition (4 times), education (4 times), press group (4 times), inquiry (3 times), backend (2 times), service (2 times), club (2 times), online education (2 times), recruitment for supporter program (2 times), big data (2 times), job support (2 times), artificial intelligence (1 time), planning (1 time), education program (1 time), education benefits (1 time), curriculum (1 time), application method (1 time), Python (1 time), application period (1 time), data analysis (1 time), meeting (1 time), job support (1 time).

The new announcement keywords are: others, job support, mentoring program, and job preparation.

The presence of the ""job support"" tag in both the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords indicates that the user might have a specific interest in job support-related content. The user has actively searched for job support 2 times, reflecting a potential concern regarding job-related opportunities.

However, the other keywords, ""others,"" ""mentoring program,"" and ""job preparation,"" do not appear in the user’s search history. This suggests that the user's interest in these themes remains uncertain.

Considering the user's substantial search record for job support and the fact that it's a direct match with the new announcement's keywords, we could infer that the user is likely interested in this new announcement. Nonetheless, the lack of searches for the other three tags suggests a possible indifference towards those specific offerings.

Overall, since job support is clearly highlighted in both records, the user may indeed show an inclination towards the announcement, while the remaining keywords may yield a less decisive interest. Therefore, the target score could be considered as indicative of the user's interest in the new announcement (1) even though the overall interest is somewhat ambiguous with respect to the other keywords presented.",0
19,"Based on the given information, the new announcement has a keyword tag of ""Competition."" The user's search history shows that they have searched for the tag ""Competition"" 6 times along with various other tags. Although the user has shown interest in different topics related to online education, application guidance, and student information, the 6 searches for the ""Competition"" tag suggest that the user likely has some level of interest in this particular topic. 

Given that the user has actively searched for related announcements multiple times, it indicates a connectedness to the content associated with the ""Competition"" keyword. Therefore, it seems plausible to conclude that they might be interested in the new announcement regarding ""Competition,"" justifying a score of 1 for interest.",0
20,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""scholarship,"" ""elementary school students,"" and ""middle school students."" However, the user's search history indicates a strong focus on tags related to ""backend,"" ""employment,"" ""cloud,"" and various programming-related keywords, with no searches for the new announcement's keywords.

Given that the user has searched frequently for keywords relevant to job preparation and technical education, it is apparent that their interests do not align with the subject matter of the new announcement, which targets educational opportunities for younger students. Since the user has never searched for any of the new announcement's keywords, it suggests a lack of interest in this particular announcement.

Therefore, the model might conclude that this user is not interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0
21,"Based on the given information, the user's search history for announcements includes tags such as ""contest"" (5 times), ""student support"" (4 times), ""employment support"" (4 times), ""credit exchange"" (4 times), ""scholarship"" (4 times), ""festival"" (4 times), ""exhibition"" (4 times), ""student assistance"" (3 times), ""employment consulting"" (3 times), ""job support"" (3 times), ""backend"" (3 times), ""event"" (3 times), ""planning"" (2 times), ""2024 academic year"" (1 time), ""AI"" (1 time), ""education"" (1 time), and ""poster"" (1 time).

However, the new announcement provided does not have any significant keywords associated with it. This lack of keywords makes it uncertain whether the user will have any interest in the announcement or not. Since the ""target score"" is 0, it further indicates that the user likely does not find the announcement engaging or relevant based on their previous searches. Therefore, we can conclude that the user is probably not interested in this new announcement, aligning with the target score of 0.",0
22,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes keywords such as ""contest,"" ""essay,"" and ""literature."" The user's search history shows they have searched for the tag ""contest"" 17 times and the tag ""planning"" 33 times.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the keyword ""contest,"" with 17 searches specifically related to it, we can infer that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement due to the relevance of one of its keywords. Although the user searched a considerable number of times for ""planning,"" it does not directly correlate with the new announcement's keywords. Therefore, the user's search history demonstrates a clear interest in the ""contest"" tag.

Considering this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, leading to a target score of 1.",1
23,"Based on the given information, the user has a history of searching for various tags related to education and employment assistance, with notable frequency in keywords like ""교육"" (education), ""취업"" (employment), and several related tags indicative of learning and career support. However, the new announcement's keywords are ""공모전"" (contest) and ""논문"" (thesis), which are quite distinct from the user's previous interests.

The user has searched extensively for ""교육"" (education) seven times and ""취업"" (employment) four times, among other relevant tags, suggesting a strong inclination towards educational content and job-related resources. Nevertheless, the absence of any related searches for contests or theses indicates that the user's interests do not currently align with the new announcement. Thus, it appears the user is not interested in this new information, resulting in a score of 0.",0
24,"Based on the given information, the user has shown interest in notifications related to ""education,"" ""participation,"" and ""lectures"" in their recent search history. The user has searched for ""lectures"" 10 times, ""education"" 6 times, and ""participation"" has not been explicitly mentioned in their search history but can be related to the acts of attending lectures or engaging in educational programs. 

The frequency of the searches for ""lectures"" and ""education"" indicates a clear interest in these topics. Although ""participation"" is not directly reflected in the user's search records, it typically aligns with the user's interest in educational events such as lectures. 

Given that the user has actively searched for related keywords such as ""lectures"" and ""education,"" it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 1 seems justified in this context, as the user's behavior suggests a keen interest in the new notification.",1

However, the new notice contains keywords such as ""Application Method,"" ""Competition,"" and ""UCC."" 

With no significant overlap between the searched keywords and the new notice's keywords, it appears that the user's interest in the new notice is low. Given that the user has a pattern of searching for different topics that do not include any of the new notice's keywords, the likelihood of the user being interested in this particular notice seems negligible. Therefore, the target score of 0 is justified.",0
26,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for the tags ""교육"" (education) 28 times and ""강연"" (lecture) 22 times. The new announcement has the keywords ""교육"" (education), ""강연"" (lecture), and ""멘토링"" (mentoring).

Given that the user has displayed a strong interest in both ""교육"" and ""강연,"" with high search frequencies of 28 and 22 respectively, it appears that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. The inclusion of these keywords in the announcement strongly correlates with the user's past search behavior, indicating a preference for these topics. However, the keyword ""멘토링"" hasn't been previously searched by the user, which introduces a small level of uncertainty. 

Overall, since the user has shown significant interest in the relevant keywords present in the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to have interest in the new announcement, which aligns with the target score of 1.",1
27,"Based on the given information, the user's interest level appears to be high regarding the new announcement. The new announcement has the following keywords: game, contest, and essay. The user's search record shows significant activity in the tag ""contest,"" which they have searched 18 times. This suggests a strong interest in contests, which aligns with one of the new announcement's keywords.

The remaining keywords, ""game"" and ""essay,"" have not been explicitly mentioned in the search records. However, the high engagement with the ""contest"" tag may indicate a general interest in related themes, such as competitions or collaborative activities, which could encompass games and essays as well.

Overall, since the user has demonstrated considerable interest in the ""contest"" tag, it logically follows that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement as well, leading to the conclusion that the target score is 1 (indicating interest).",1
28,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history includes the following tags: ""education"" (24 times), ""contest"" (15 times), and ""planning"" (11 times). The new announcement contains the keywords ""youth,"" ""planning,"" and ""contest.""

The user's search history demonstrates a strong interest in education with 24 searches, and they have also searched for the contest keyword 15 times and planning 11 times. Although the keyword ""youth"" does not appear in the user's search history, the presence of ""planning"" and ""contest"" in both the user's searches and the new announcement suggests that the user may have interest in the new announcement.

Given this pattern, it can be inferred that the user is likely interested in the new announcement due to their previous engagement with related keywords. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the target score for this user would be 1, indicating they have an interest in the new announcement.",1

Since there is no direct correlation between the searched tags and the keyword ""bootcamp,"" it appears that the user does not have a specific interest in this new notice. Thus, the target score is 0, indicating that the user is unlikely to be interested in the announcement.",0
30,"Based on the given information, the new announcement's keyword information includes the tags ""Poster,"" ""Contest,"" and ""UCC."" The user's recent search history indicates that they have searched for the tag ""COVID-19"" 31 times and the tag ""Contest"" 19 times. 

Considering that the user has shown a significant interest in the ""Contest"" tag, which aligns with one of the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user may be interested in the announcement. Although there is a substantial interest in ""COVID-19,"" it does not relate to the new announcement. Therefore, since the user has specifically searched the ""Contest"" tag multiple times, it indicates a possible interest in the announcement related to contests. 

Thus, the target score of 1 implies that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.",1
31,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement.

Since none of the tags in the user's search history match the new announcement's keywords, which are ""scholarship"" and ""eligibility,"" it can be concluded that the user is unlikely to be interested in this announcement. Therefore, the lack of overlap in their search activities supports the conclusion of no interest in the new information.",0

The user demonstrates a considerable interest in the keywords related to the new notice, as they have searched for Education (5 times), Festival (5 times), Mentoring (3 times), and Exhibition (3 times). This shows a direct relevance to the new notice, indicating that the user is likely interested in the notice. However, the search for ""Event"" is particularly noteworthy since it aligns perfectly with one of the new notice keywords. 

Considering the above analysis, the user's search activity suggests that they are likely to have an interest in the newly announced notice, as reflected by the presence of relevant keywords in their search history. Therefore, it can be concluded that the user's interest in the new notice is indicated by the score of 1.",1

Given that the user has frequently searched for the tag ""Education"" 24 times, it indicates a substantial level of interest in educational topics. Furthermore, the presence of ""Education"" and ""Education Program"" in the new notice's keywords aligns closely with the user's interests. 

However, the tags ""Job Support,"" ""Vocational Training,"" ""Lecture,"" and ""Mentoring"" do not appear in the user's prior search history, demonstrating that while there is a focused interest in educational content, the user's connection to other aspects of the new notice may be limited.

However, since the majority of the user's searches are focused on other themes like recruitment announcements and mentoring, it may suggest that their primary interests lie elsewhere. Therefore, while there is a connection to the topic, the user’s overall focus seems to be more on broader themes rather than specifically on ""2024학년도.""

Since the user has shown significant interest in the keyword ""education"" by searching for it 24 times, it indicates that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement, particularly as it includes the same keyword. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1

The new notice keywords include ""Education,"" ""Exhibition,"" ""Festival,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Event."" 

Given that the user has searched for ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring"" multiple times (8 and 7 times, respectively), it indicates a strong interest in these topics. Additionally, ""Education,"" which is part of the new notice keywords, has also been searched 6 times, suggesting that the user may have a general interest in educational content.

Therefore, since several keywords from the new notice align with the user's search history and demonstrate repeated interest in related topics, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice, resulting in a target score of 1.",1
41,"Based on the given information, the target score is 0, indicating that the user is not interested in the new announcement. The keyword information for the new announcement includes ""COVID-19,"" which is quite specific and does not align with the user's previous search history.

This absence of relevant searches suggests that the user may not have an interest in the topic of the new announcement, which makes it reasonable to conclude that the user is likely uninterested, as reflected in the target score of 0.",0

The user has shown a clear interest in the ""club"" and ""meeting"" keywords based on their previous search records, as they searched for these terms 8 times each. This suggests a strong inclination toward the topics associated with these keywords. Additionally, the user has searched for ""volunteer"" 6 times, indicating a moderate interest in this topic as well, while ""literature"" is not reflected in their previous searches.

Considering the strong search frequency for ""club"" and ""meeting,"" it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice, resulting in a goal score of 1. This implies that the user may actively seek out related information or events that align with their previous searches.",1
43,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates a strong interest in the keyword ""교육"" (education), as it has been searched 8 times. However, there is no record of the user searching for the keyword ""동아리"" (club). Given that the user has a significant interest in ""교육,"" it is reasonable to assume that they may have a passive interest in announcements related to this keyword. However, the absence of searches related to ""동아리"" makes it challenging to gauge their interest in that specific aspect of the new announcement. Overall, while there is some indication of interest due to the frequent searches for ""교육,"" the complete lack of engagement with ""동아리"" suggests that the user may not find the announcement particularly appealing. Thus, the target score is marked as 0, indicating a lack of overall interest in this particular new announcement.",0

The user has frequently searched for ""contest,"" indicating a strong interest in this topic. Additionally, the keyword ""poster,"" which the user has searched for 8 times, also aligns with the new announcement. This suggests that the user likely has a considerable interest in both keywords associated with the new announcement. 

Therefore, the user's interest appears positive, and it is likely that they would be engaged with the new announcement, leading to a target score of 1.",1

However, the new announcement has keywords ""education"" and ""employment."" 

Considering that the user has extensively searched for ""education,"" this suggests a strong interest in educational content. Although ""employment"" was not directly searched in the user's history, the high frequency of ""education"" in their search history may indicate an interest in related topics like employment opportunities tied to educational experiences.

Overall, since the user has a clear interest in ""education"" and the new announcement contains this keyword, it is logical to conclude that the user might be interested in this announcement as well, hence the target score of 1.",1

However, the new announcement's keywords are ""other support"" and ""general public."" There are no direct matches or indications that the user has searched for these specific keywords in their history.

Given that the user has not shown any interest in the keywords of the new announcement, it is logical to conclude that they are unlikely to be interested in it, hence the target score of 0.",0
47,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates they have not shown clear interest in the new announcement keywords, which are ""employment,"" ""entrepreneurship,"" and ""internship."" 

The user's search history includes tags related to ""training incentive"" (4 times), ""employment support"" (4 times), and various other educational and job-training keywords. However, none of these tags directly correlate with the new announcement's keywords.

While the user has frequently searched for tags related to employment, they have not specifically searched for ""internships"" or ""entrepreneurship"" at all. This suggests a limited interest in the specific themes of the new announcement.

Therefore, considering the lack of relevant keyword searches associated with the new announcement and the user's focused searches on other areas, it seems that the user is likely not interested in this new announcement, evidenced by the target score of 0.",0

The new announcement contains keywords related to ""exhibition,"" ""event,"" ""festival,"" and ""employment support."" 

Given that the user searched for ""employment support"" 3 times but showed no interest in the other new keywords, it seems apparent that the user does not have a strong interest in the new announcement. Even though ""employment support"" aligns with one of the new keywords, the lack of significant search frequency regarding the other keywords indicates a limited general interest in this specific announcement.

The new notification contains the keywords ""Application Method"" and ""Event."" Since the user has searched for ""Application Method"" 11 times and ""Event"" 6 times, it indicates a strong interest in these topics. This consistent engagement with the relevant keywords suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new notification, thus supporting the rating of 1 for the target score.",1
50,"Based on the given information, the user's interest level in the new announcement can be deduced as follows.

However, the new announcement does not contain any significant keywords. This absence of relevant keywords indicates that the user might not be particularly interested in the new announcement, as there are no connecting topics with their search history. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to find this announcement appealing, resulting in a goal rating of 0.",0
51,"Based on the given information, the user's search history shows that they have searched for the keywords ""employment"" 8 times, ""eligibility requirements"" 8 times, ""education"" 7 times, ""recruitment announcement"" 7 times, and ""application method"" 7 times. The new notice contains keywords ""application method,"" ""education,"" and ""employment."" 

Since the user has shown significant interest in ""employment"" by searching for it 8 times, as well as a good amount of interest in ""education,"" the user's interest appears quite strong in the new notice's keywords. Although there is no direct mention of ""eligibility requirements"" in the new notice, the presence of the other two keywords that the user has frequently searched suggests that they are likely to be interested in the notice. Therefore, it indicates a positive sentiment towards the new announcement. 

In this case, the target score of 1 implies that the user is showing interest in the new notice based on their previous search history aligning well with its keywords.",1
52,"Based on the given information, the user's search history includes tags related to education, servers, management, job support, cloud, scholarships, educational benefits, trade, and job consulting, with frequent searches in each category. However, the new announcement keywords are scholarship, college student, and regional criteria. 

Given that the user has searched for ""scholarship"" 5 times and it is one of the new announcement keywords, there is a clear indication of interest. Although there are no repeated searches specifically for ""college student"" or ""regional criteria"", the presence of ""scholarship"" could suggest that the user is interested in benefits related to education, particularly scholarships for students.

However, the overall search pattern focuses more on education and job support rather than specifically on scholarships for college students in a regional context. This makes it somewhat uncertain as there is not a strong correlation with all the new tags. Therefore, while there is a slight indication of interest due to the ""scholarship"" tag, the absence of explicit alignment with all the new keywords may reflect a lesser degree of interest in the specific announcement.

Thus, the final assessment for the target score is 0, indicating that the user is likely not highly interested in the new announcement based on the combination of their search history and the provided keywords.",0
53,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for the tag ""COVID-19"" 50 times, which shows a strong interest in that topic. However, the new announcement's keywords include ""Supporters,"" ""Employment,"" and ""Internship,"" none of which align with the user's recent searches.

However, the new notification only has a single keyword: ""application."" 

Given that the user has not searched for anything specifically related to ""application"" in the past 50 searches, one could argue that there is no direct indication of interest in this new notification. The user's search history suggests they may be more focused on topics like competitions and educational programs, rather than on applications. As a result, the user's goal score of 0 aligns with this analysis, indicating a lack of interest in the current announcement.",0
55,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows that they have searched for various tags multiple times, including ""Festival"" 7 times, ""Scholarship"" 6 times, ""Student Support"" 6 times, and others.

Although the user has shown significant interest in ""Scholarship,"" which aligns with one of the new announcement's keywords, there is no indication that they have searched for ""Eligibility"" as it does not appear in their keyword history. This ambiguity leaves us uncertain about the user's interest level. The strong interest in ""Scholarship"" suggests that the user may have some curiosity regarding the new announcement, but without a related search for ""Eligibility,"" we cannot definitively conclude that the user is interested in the overall new announcement. 

Therefore, the goal rating of 0 indicates that despite some relevant searches, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that the user is fully engaged or interested in the new announcement.",0

The new notice contains keywords such as ""employment consulting,"" ""job preparation,"" ""education,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring program,"" and ""mentoring."" 

Since the user has searched for ""education"" 9 times and ""mentoring"" 6 times, it shows a solid interest in these areas. Although they have not searched specifically for ""employment consulting"" or ""job preparation,"" their high frequency in related tags suggests that they likely have a general interest in educational and mentoring opportunities, which could correspond with the new notice.

Since the user has searched ""contest"" 6 times, there is a slight indication of interest in this keyword, though it is not a strong or predominant interest. Additionally, the absence of searches related to ""AI"" and ""UCC"" suggests that the user may not have any interest in these topics.

Ultimately, with the user’s searches mostly concentrated on ""design"" and ""planning,"" and only a limited search on ""contest,"" it seems they do not have a robust interest in the new notice, which leads to a conclusion that the user is likely not interested in this new notice (0).",0

The new announcement has keywords ""competition"" and ""application period"". The user has shown significant interest in ""competition"" by searching for it 17 times, which indicates a strong propensity to be interested in any announcements related to this topic. Although ""application period"" is not directly reflected in the user’s search history, the overwhelming frequency of searches regarding ""competition"" suggests that the user is likely to be interested in this new announcement.

The strong search frequency for this related keyword suggests that the user has an inclination towards announcements involving contests.

Given that the user has shown a strong interest in the ""design"" tag by searching it 22 times, this suggests that they may have a notable interest in related subjects. The presence of ""design"" in the new announcement's keyword information further aligns with the user's search history, indicating a level of interest in the announcement.

The new announcement keywords are ""event"" and ""education."" The user has demonstrated interest in the ""event"" tag by searching it 4 times. However, there are no search records that indicate interest in the ""education"" tag. 

Taking all of this into account, the information suggests that the user likely has some interest in the announcement due to the repeated searches related to the ""event"" tag. Nonetheless, without any corresponding searches for the ""education"" tag, their overall enthusiasm for the new announcement remains somewhat unclear. Hence, it would be judged that the user does not show strong interest in the new announcement, leading to a target score of 0.",0
82,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new notice. The keyword information for the new notice does not contain any significant keywords, suggesting that it may not capture the user's attention effectively.

The user's search history shows a variety of interests such as marketing, planning, meetings, and events, with specific keywords searched multiple times, such as ""marketing"" and ""planning"" with 7 and 5 searches respectively. Despite the repeated searches for these keywords, the absence of relevant keywords in the new notice likely contributes to the user's lack of interest.

Overall, since there are no key terms in the new notice that align with the user's previous search behavior, it explains why the user might feel disinterested, leading to a goal score of 0.",0
83,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history indicates a strong interest in various announcement-related tags. The user searched for ""공모전"" 17 times, which suggests a significant engagement with competitions.

There is no overlap between the user's search history and the new announcement keywords, indicating that the user has not shown interest in these specific topics.

Given that there are no relevant searches in the user's history for the new announcement keywords and the target score is 0, it seems that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new announcement.

84,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a significant interest in the keyword ""기획,"" searching it 33 times, while searching for ""공모전"" 17 times. The new announcement keywords include ""공모전"" and ""UCC."" Since the user has previously searched ""공모전"" 17 times, it indicates that they might have some level of interest in it. However, there is no record of the user searching ""UCC,"" which makes that keyword less relevant in terms of user interest.

Given this data, it seems likely that the user will have some interest in the new announcement due to the repeated search of ""공모전."" Therefore, the user's interest level can be logically deduced to be 1 (indicating interest).",1
85,"Based on the given information, the user's ""notice search records"" show that they have searched for the tags ""supporters"" 15 times, ""reporter group"" 14 times, ""planning"" 11 times, and ""student participation"" 10 times. However, the new notice contains the keywords ""competition,"" ""essay,"" and ""literature,"" which are not represented in the user's search history. 

This significant difference between the user's past interests and the new notice keywords indicates that the user is likely not interested in this new notice. Therefore, the target score of 0 seems justified as there is no overlap or indication of interest in the subjects presented in the new notice.",0
86,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Lecture,"" ""Free Education,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Education."" The user has shown a notable interest in related topics, as reflected in their search history. They have searched for ""Mentoring"" 5 times, ""Lecture"" 5 times, and ""Education"" 7 times, indicating a consistent engagement with these areas. Additionally, while the keyword ""Free Education"" wasn't explicitly mentioned in the user's search history, the presence of ""Education"" suggests a potential interest in related educational opportunities.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in both ""Lecture"" and ""Education,"" it appears that they are likely to find this announcement relevant. Therefore, the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, leading to a target score of 1.",1
87,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords ""contest"" and ""design."" In reviewing the user's search history, it appears that they have searched for ""design"" 3 times. However, there are no records of searches related to ""contest."" 

Since ""design"" is one of the keywords in the new announcement and the user has shown a moderate level of interest in it by searching for it 3 times, there is a possibility that they may have some interest in the new announcement. However, the lack of any searches related to ""contest"" makes the overall interest unclear.

Therefore, we can conclude that the user might have some interest in the new announcement, particularly due to the relevant searches for ""design,"" but the absence of searches for ""contest"" suggests that their interest could be limited. This leads us to a tentative evaluation of the target score as 0.",0
88,"Based on the given information, the user has a history of searching for various tags related to announcements. Specifically, they have searched for ""planning"" 14 times, ""education"" 9 times, ""contest"" 7 times, ""mentoring"" 6 times, ""lecture"" 5 times, ""registration period"" 5 times, and ""poster"" 4 times. The new announcement has keywords including ""employment,"" ""internship,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" and ""startup.""

Given that the user has shown a notable interest in ""lecture"" (5 times) and ""mentoring"" (6 times), as well as a substantial interest in ""education"" (9 times), it is likely that they have a positive inclination towards the new announcement. Moreover, while ""employment"" and ""internship"" do not appear in the user's search history, the presence of related tags like ""lecture"" and ""mentoring"" suggests that the user may still find relevance in the new content. 

Overall, the combination of their previous searches indicates a strong likelihood that the user is interested in the new announcement, leading to a predicted engagement score of 1.",1
89,"Based on the given information, the keywords for the new announcement are ""Participation,"" ""Contest,"" and ""Essay."" The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""Contest"" 17 times, ""Participation"" 4 times, and other tags related to the contest theme multiple times, such as ""Event"" (3 times) and ""Submission Period"" (2 times). 

This suggests that the user has a strong interest in contests and participation as shown by the higher frequency of searches for these tags. The repeated searches for ""Contest"" and ""Participation"" indicate that the user is likely engaged with these subjects. Since the new announcement's keywords align with their search history, it can be inferred that the user has an interest in the announcement, thus resulting in a target score of 1.",1
90,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new announcement regarding COVID-19. The keyword information for the new announcement focuses solely on ""COVID-19,"" which does not align with the user's recent search records. 

The user's recent searches include keywords related to scholarships (7 times), eligibility for applicants (7 times), supporters (7 times), employment (6 times), free education (6 times), events (5 times), planning (4 times), target participants (4 times), and awards (4 times). However, there is no mention of any keywords related to COVID-19 in their search history. 

Since the user has not searched for any keywords related to COVID-19, it can be concluded that they likely do not have an interest in this announcement. This absence of relevant search activity suggests that the user is not inclined towards the topic of the new announcement, reinforcing the goal score of 0.",0
91,"Based on the given information, the user's ""notification search history"" indicates that they have searched for ""server"" 9 times and ""cloud"" 8 times. Since the new notice's keywords include ""server"" and ""cloud,"" which the user has frequently searched, it suggests a strong interest in these topics. The high frequency of searches for both keywords indicates that the user is likely interested in this new notification, aligning with the goal score of 1.",1

The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""contract job"" 11 times, ""hiring announcement"" 8 times, and ""reception period"" 7 times, among other related terms. 

Given that the user has shown significant interest in all three relevant keywords through multiple searches, it strongly suggests that they are indeed interested in the new announcement.

93,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for the keywords related to ""scholarship"" 27 times and ""2024 academic year"" 23 times. However, the new announcement's keywords are ""employment,"" ""bootcamp,"" and ""design."" 

Considering the user's search history, there seems to be a lack of direct relevance to the new announcement's topics. The user has shown much interest in scholarships and academic year-related information but has not searched for anything closely related to employment, bootcamps, or design. 

Therefore, the absence of relevant searches for the new keywords suggests that the user is likely not interested in the new announcement. Thus, the target score can be inferred as 0.",0
94,"Based on the given information, the user's ""notification search history"" shows significant interest in various tags related to education and career development, with the keyword 'education' being searched 9 times and 'lectures' 6 times. However, the new notification's keywords are 'student participation' and 'recruitment', which do not directly align with the tags that the user has shown interest in. 

The absence of any related keywords in the user's recent searches suggests that they may not find this new notification particularly relevant or interesting. Given the total lack of direct connections between their previous searches and the new notification's keywords, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in this particular announcement, thus justifying a target rating of 0.",0

The user's search history includes a significant focus on ""Education"" (10 times), ""Employment"" (7 times), and ""Youth"" (6 times), among others. However, there are no searches related to ""Planning"" or ""Contest.""

Given that the user has never searched for the newly introduced keywords, it indicates a lack of interest in these specific topics. Since the user has shown considerable engagement with other areas, particularly ""Education"" and ""Employment,"" it seems they may not be inclined towards the current announcement's focus, leading to the conclusion that they likely do not have an interest in this new information.

Instead, the user has searched for tags such as ""Winter Semester,"" ""Credit Exchange,"" ""Student Support,"" ""Application Guide,"" and ""Scholarship"" multiple times. 

Given that the user has been focused on different topics that do not include ""Curriculum,"" it suggests that the user might not have a specific interest in the new notice. Thus, the objective score of 0 indicates a lack of demonstrated interest in this particular notice. This scenario appears to reflect a disconnect between the user's past search behavior and the content of the new notice.",0

Given that the user has actively searched for keywords related to the new announcement, it suggests that they have a clear interest in this content.

However, the new notice's keyword is ""club.""

Given that there are no recorded searches related to the keyword ""club"" in the user's history, it suggests that the user likely does not have an interest in this particular notice.

99,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates a preference for the keywords ""KAU"" (18 times), ""모집"" (17 times), and ""학생 참여"" (15 times). However, the new announcement's keywords—big data, server, cybersecurity, security, government support, AI, cloud, Ministry of Employment and Labor, and cloud infrastructure—do not align with any of the user's previous searches. This suggests that the user likely has no interest in the new announcement, as there is no overlap between their search history and the keywords presented in the new announcement.

The user's search history shows that they have searched for tags related to contests (""16 times""), education (""15 times""), target participants (""11 times""), and seminars (""8 times""). However, since the new announcement lacks any relevant keywords, it suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in this particular announcement.

The keywords from the new announcement overlap with the user's search history, particularly with ""credit exchange"" and ""winter semester."" Given that the user has shown significant interest in ""credit exchange"" and has searched for ""winter semester"" as well, it suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement.

The user's search history shows a significant interest in ""event,"" with a total of 8 searches for ""행사,"" 8 searches for ""event,"" and 8 searches for ""이벤트."" Since the user has repeatedly searched for related terms that match the new notice's keywords, it indicates a strong interest in this type of content.

Since the tags in the user's search history do not overlap with the keywords from the new notice, it suggests that the user is not interested in the new notice related to clubs, meetings, and volunteering.

104,"Based on the given information, the user has searched the keywords related to ""COVID-19"" 31 times and ""Competition"" 19 times. The new notice contains the keywords ""Application Method,"" ""Competition,"" and ""UCC."" 

The user has shown significant interest in ""Competition"" as evidenced by the search history, particularly because the user has searched for related content 19 times. While the search frequency of ""COVID-19"" is high, it does not directly relate to the keywords in the new notice aside from ""Competition."" Thus, the user seems to have a clear interest in opportunities related to competitions. 

Considering this, it’s logical to deduce that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice, as it includes the ""Competition"" keyword that aligns with their search history. Therefore, the predicted rating is 1, indicating that the user is expected to be interested in the new notice.",1

While the user has shown some interest in ""Scholarship,"" which aligns with the new notice's theme, the lack of specific search entries related to ""University Student"" and ""Graduate Student"" suggests that their interest may not be strong or focused enough on these particular tags. Therefore, the model might interpret this as a lower likelihood of the user being interested in the new notice, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

The new notice contains the keywords planning (""기획""), competition (""공모전""), and essay (""수필""). 

Since the user has actively searched for the tags ""공모전"" (11 times) and ""수필"" (11 times), it indicates a significant interest in these areas. Although ""기획"" is not present in the user's search history, the repeated searches for the other two keywords suggest a strong likelihood that the user would be interested in the new notice since it aligns with their previous interests. Therefore, based on the correlation of the user's search records with the keywords of the new notice, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in this notice, represented by a target score of 1.",1
109,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords ""contest"" and ""essay."" The user's search history indicates they have searched for ""planning"" 33 times and ""contest"" 17 times. 

Given that the user has a strong interest in ""planning"" but has also searched for ""contest"" multiple times, it suggests that the user may have some level of interest in the new announcement, which includes the ""contest"" keyword. However, there is no evidence of interest in the keyword ""essay,"" as it does not appear in the search history. The user's significant searches for ""planning"" may not align directly with the new keywords but could indicate a broader interest in related topics. 

Thus, while it is clear that the user has engaged with the ""contest"" keyword before, the lack of a connection to ""essay"" makes it somewhat ambiguous regarding their overall interest in the new announcement.

This shows a strong interest in the topic of education, as evidenced by the high search count. Additionally, the user has also searched for the related keyword ""youth,"" albeit less frequently.

However, while the user does show a clear interest in education-related content, ""supporters"" does not appear in the search history at all. 

Given this mixed evidence, it is somewhat ambiguous whether the user is interested in the new notice. Although the strong interest in ""education"" suggests that they may be open to related information, the absence of searches related to ""supporters"" means that the overall interest in the new notice may not be substantial. Therefore, we can infer that the user is likely disinterested in the new notice, aligning with the target score of 0.",0

Since there is no overlap between the new notice's keywords and the user's previous searches, it appears that the user is not likely to be interested in this notice.

While the user’s search records do not directly align with the keywords of ""club"" and ""meeting,"" the frequent searches for ""education,"" ""lecture,"" and ""mentoring"" suggest that the user may have an interest in educational opportunities that could be linked to the content of the new announcement.

Since the user has repeatedly searched for themes that intersect with the new announcement’s focus on ""education,"" it is likely that they are interested in the connection these announcements provide—particularly where education-related activities such as mentoring and lectures are concerned.

This indicates that the user has some interest in contests as shown by the 19 searches, which suggests they may be curious about the new announcement related to contests. However, since the search frequency for ""contest"" is less than that for ""COVID-19,"" it remains unclear whether their primary interest lies more with contests or with other topics.

Thus, while there is evidence of interest (19 searches for ""contest""), the overall balance of their search history suggests they may prioritize COVID-19 more heavily.

Given that the user has conducted multiple searches for ""education"" (12 times), it demonstrates significant interest in that area. The 5 searches on ""lecture"" also indicate a moderate level of interest in this keyword. 

Thus, since both keywords from the new announcement are present and have considerable search activity in the user's records, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in this announcement, leading to the goal score of 1.",1
125,"Based on the given information, the user's search history includes keywords related to contests (16 times), education (15 times), target audience (11 times), and seminars (8 times). The new announcement, however, contains keywords such as planning, contest, and application period. 

The user has shown a significant interest in the keyword ""contest"" by searching it 16 times, which suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement that includes this keyword. While the other keywords in the new announcement (planning and application period) do not correlate directly with the user's search history, the strong interest in ""contest"" indicates a potential relevance to the user's preferences. 

Given this analysis, it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, and this aligns with the provided target score of 1.",1

Since the user's search history does not include any instances of the keywords related to the new announcement, it indicates a lack of interest in these topics. While the user has shown considerable interest in tags related to education and events, there is no direct correlation to the keywords presented in the new announcement. Therefore, it appears that the user is unlikely to be interested in this particular announcement, which aligns with a target score of 0.",0

The user's search history shows a record of 50 searches for the keyword ""contest."" Given that the user has specifically searched for the keyword ""contest"" 50 times, it strongly indicates a high level of interest in that topic. Moreover, although there are additional keywords present in the new notice, the predominant interest in ""contest"" suggests that the user is likely to have an interest in the notice as a whole.

This presents a scenario where the user's past interests lie within a different context compared to the new announcement's keyword.

The user's search history shows a significant interest in related tags, with ""education"" being searched 10 times and ""lecture"" being searched 6 times. This strong frequency in searching for ""education"" and the presence of ""lecture"" in the search history indicate that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

Given that the user has searched ""planning"" and ""competition"" multiple times, there seems to be a strong interest in these topics, which aligns with the new announcement's keywords. Specifically, the user has explored ""planning"" and ""competition"" extensively, which indicates they may find the new announcement relevant and interesting.

Conversely, while the absence of ""support methods"" in the user's search history leaves some ambiguity, the strong focus on the other keywords suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in this announcement, aligning with the provided target score of 1.",1

Despite the user showing a strong interest in keywords related to education and lectures, they did not search for any of the other relevant keywords from the new announcement, such as club, seminar, gathering, mentoring, or volunteering. This limited overlap may suggest a low likelihood of the user being interested in this specific announcement, as their searches do not indicate a broader interest in the other topics presented.

The new announcement includes the following keywords: ""Contact Information,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Job Support,"" ""Start-up,"" ""Job Preparation,"" ""Education,"" ""Internship,"" and ""Mentoring."" Among these, ""Job Support"" and ""Education"" are present in both the user's search history and the new announcement.

The user has shown a significant interest in ""Job Support"" with 13 searches, indicating a strong likelihood that they will be interested in anything related to job support, including this new announcement. Additionally, they have searched ""Education"" 7 times, which aligns with another keyword in the new announcement. 

Given that these two relevant keywords appear frequently in the user's search history and also match those in the new announcement, it can be logically concluded that the user is likely to have an interest in this announcement.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the user's interest level in the new announcement can be classified as 1 (indicating interest).",1

The user's search history includes ""빅데이터"" and ""AI,"" both of which are also present in the new notice.

Given that the user has shown considerable interest in ""AI"" with 15 searches, and some interest in ""빅데이터"" with 4 searches, it indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the announcement. Therefore, we can infer that the target score of 1, which represents interest, is justified based on their keyword searches.",1

The user's search history includes the following tags: ""credit exchange"" (17 times), ""next-generation communication"" (12 times), ""winter session"" (11 times), ""student recruitment"" (6 times), and ""application guide"" (4 times).

The user has shown a significant interest in ""credit exchange"" by searching for it 17 times, which directly relates to one of the keywords in the new announcement. This strong search behavior suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement regarding credit exchange despite the absence of searches related to ""course registration.""

Furthermore, the unique emphasis on ""credit exchange"" in the user's search history indicates a targeted interest in this area, which correlates with the announcement's content. Given this context, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

Therefore, the predicted target score is 1, indicating the user is interested in the announcement.",1

However, the user's search records indicate a significant focus on other topics such as ""employment support"" (5 times), ""education"" (5 times), and related tags like ""mentoring"" (4 times) and ""recruitment announcement"" (3 times). The absence of any searches for ""event"" or ""행사"" suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in this notice.

However, the new announcement contains keywords that are entirely different: ""server"" and ""cloud"".

Given that the user has not searched for anything related to ""server"" or ""cloud,"" it can be inferred that the user does not have a particular interest in this new announcement based on their previous search behavior. The absence of relevant searches corresponding to the announcement’s keywords implies that the user is unlikely to engage with this new information, thus leading to the conclusion that the target rating for this announcement would be 0, indicating no interest.",0

The new announcement contains the following key tags: ""Club,"" ""Gathering,"" ""Student Participation,"" and ""Volunteer.""

Given that the user has actively searched for ""Club"" and ""Volunteer"" multiple times, it indicates a significant interest in these categories. Additionally, the presence of ""Gathering"" and ""Student Participation"" in the new announcement aligns with the user's previous searches. Even though ""Gathering"" was only searched 3 times, it still represents an area of potential interest.

The user's previous searches show no direct correlation with the new notice's keywords, indicating a lack of interest.

However, the new notice contains keywords that include guitar, web development, frontend development, and education for non-majors. 

Since there are no overlapping keywords between the user's search history and the new notice, it seems that the user may not have an interest in the newly provided notice.

Since ""Student Support"" does not directly correlate with any of the frequently searched terms, it can be inferred that the user likely doesn't have a strong interest in this specific announcement. The user's search patterns suggest a focus on planning, education, and application processes, rather than support for students. Therefore, their lack of relevant searches for ""Student Support"" leads to the decision that they may not find the new announcement appealing.",0

Since the user's search history indicates a significant interest in ""online education"" and ""job preparation,"" there may be some relevance to ""free education"" and ""employment support"" in the new announcement. However, terms such as ""web development,"" ""backend,"" and ""frontend"" are not explicitly represented in the search history, making it difficult to conclude definitively whether the user is interested in this particular announcement.

Given that the target score is 0, this suggests that the user does not find the new announcement relevant. The absence of direct matches in the search history related specifically to the new announcement’s keywords weakens the case for interest.

The user's search history primarily focuses on specific technology-related content, showing no engagement with the topics of ""participants"" or ""paper.""

This suggests that the user's previous interests lean more towards planning and contests, rather than the educational and employment-related themes present in the new notice. The absence of any overlaps between the user's recent searches and the keywords of the new notification highlights a lack of connection to the user's preferences.

Although the search history shows consistent engagement with terms related to job support and education, the absence of any relevant keywords from the new announcement creates ambiguity. The user has shown interest in these areas based on their search patterns, but without aligning keywords in the new announcement, we cannot ascertain a clear connection.

The new notice includes the keywords ""event,"" ""education,"" and ""lecture."" Given that the user has previously searched for the keyword ""lecture"" 10 times along with ""education"" 6 times, there is a strong indication of interest in these areas. Although the user has not searched specifically for ""event,"" the related searches for educational activities suggest that the user may still be inclined towards this new notice.

Considering the user's search history and the relevance of the new keywords, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice, thus supporting a score of 1 (indicating interest).",1

Since none of these keywords correlate with the ""Scholarship"" tag, it suggests that the user's interests lie elsewhere. The absence of any searches related to scholarships implies a lack of interest in the new notice, supporting the conclusion that the user is unlikely to engage with the scholarship announcement.",0
169,"Based on the given information, the user has shown no interest in the newly announced information, as indicated by the target score of 0.

This disparity suggests that the user is not engaged with the topics of the new announcement. Their interest, as displayed in their recent searches, is clearly centered around project planning, educational opportunities in AI, application guidelines, and related fields. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is not likely to be interested in the new announcement regarding Supporters and related activities, as evidenced by their search behavior showing no relevance to these new tags.",0

However, the new announcement's keywords include ""scholarship,"" ""middle school student,"" and ""high school student."" None of the previously searched keywords directly align with these new topics. The user's focus appears to be more on community engagement and educational activities rather than specific announcements related to scholarships for middle or high school students.

Given this discrepancy between the search history and the new announcement keywords, it can be concluded that there is no demonstrable interest from the user in this particular announcement. Therefore, the target score of 0, indicating a lack of interest, is consistent with the information provided.",0

The new announcement includes the keywords ""lecture,"" ""content creation,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" and ""application method."" Notably, the user has searched for ""lecture"" 7 times and ""mentoring"" 6 times. This suggests that the user has a strong interest in both ""lecture"" and ""mentoring,"" which are among the keywords in the new announcement. On the other hand, the other keywords ""content creation"" and ""application method"" did not appear in the user's search history.

Considering this, it seems plausible that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement since there is a clear overlap between their previous searches and the relevant keywords.

Although the user has shown interest in educational themes with tags like ""Mentoring"" and ""Education,"" these keywords do not align with the specific tags of the new announcement.

Given that the user has shown a significant interest in the keyword ""Contest"" with 18 searches, and also has a considerable level of interest in ""Planning"" with 8 searches, it can be logically inferred that the user is likely interested in the new notice, as it aligns closely with their previous searches.

The absence of any searches related to ""student participation"" or ""educational programs"" suggests that the user is not engaged with the new announcement's topics. The existing interests in diverse areas such as academic credits and telecommunications highlight a lack of focus on student-centric initiatives. Therefore, it appears that the user is likely not interested in this announcement, supporting the conclusion of a target score of 0.",0

The new announcement has keywords related to ""Contest"" and ""UCC."" Given that the user has searched for ""Contest"" a significant number of times (18 times), it indicates a strong interest in this topic. Additionally, the user has also searched for ""UCC"" 5 times, suggesting some level of interest as well.

Taking into account the substantial searches for the ""Contest"" keyword and the presence of ""UCC"" in the search history, it appears that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score reflects a positive indication of interest (1).",1

However, since none of these keywords are present in the new announcement, it suggests that the user may not find the announcement relevant or appealing.

The new notice contains keywords: ""employment,"" ""supporters,"" ""reporters,"" ""entrepreneurship,"" and ""internship.""

The keyword ""employment"" aligns directly with the user's interest, as it is the most searched term in their history, with 17 searches. This suggests that the user is highly interested in job-related announcements. 

However, the keywords ""supporters,"" ""reporters,"" ""entrepreneurship,"" and ""internship"" have not been searched at all by the user in their recent history. This lack of interest in the additional keywords makes it difficult to conclude that the user is fully engaged with the new notice.

Considering the strong presence of ""employment"" in the user's search history, it appears that the user does have some level of interest in the new notice, particularly due to the relevance of ""employment."" However, the uncertainty regarding the other keywords suggests that the user's interest level may not be as strong for the complete range of the new notice.

Thus, the overall conclusion is that the user likely has some interest (1) in the new notice due to the relevance of the ""employment"" keyword, but the overall interest level may vary depending on the other keywords.",1

Notably, the user has searched for ""교육"" (education) 18 times, indicating a strong interest in this area. Although there are no direct matches for ""청년"" (youth) and ""취업"" (employment) in the user's search history, the substantial interest in education suggests that the user may still engage with related topics.

With the goal rating of 1 indicating an interest in the announcement, it can be inferred that the user's established interest in education aligns positively with the keywords from the new announcement, particularly ""교육"" (education). Thus, the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, leading to a conclusion that the target rating should be 1.",1

The user's search history reflects an interest predominantly in creative and academic topics rather than technical or employment-related topics that are present in the new announcement's keywords. The lack of any searches related to web development or any of the other specific keywords in the new announcement suggests a clear disinterest or irrelevance of this announcement to the user. Therefore, despite some engagement in various areas, the absence of relevant keyword searches strongly indicates that the user is not interested in the new announcement.",0

The user's search history indicates that they have searched for related tags such as ""Contest"" 16 times, ""Education"" 15 times, ""Participant Criteria"" 11 times, and ""Seminar"" 8 times.

Since none of the tags in the user's recent searches align with the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user does not have a specific interest in the information provided by this announcement.

This indicates a clear interest in the relevant topics, especially since the user has repeatedly looked for ""Scholarship,"" which is directly aligned with the key information of the new notice. Although they have not searched for ""Regional Criteria,"" the strong search frequency for ""Scholarship"" suggests that they may still find the new notice interesting. 

Given the user's past behavior and the direct relevance of the presented tags, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to have interest in the new notice. Therefore, it seems appropriate to assign a target score of 1.",1

The new announcement contains the keywords ""Event,"" ""Education,"" and ""Lecture.""

Given that the user has searched for ""Lecture"" multiple times, totaling 9 searches, and has also expressed a significant interest in ""Education"" with 8 searches, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. The presence of these related keywords in both the announcement and the user's search history indicates a strong alignment, suggesting a keen interest in the announcement's content.

The new announcement has keywords: ""planning,"" ""contest,"" and ""essay."" Given that the user has frequently searched for ""contest"" and ""planning,"" it suggests that they are likely interested in the new announcement. The significant number of searches for ""contest"" (10 times) indicates a strong interest, while the 8 searches for ""planning"" further support this conclusion.

Given that the user has searched for all three keywords associated with the new notice multiple times, it strongly indicates that the user is interested in this notice.

The new announcement contains the keywords ""공모전"" (competition) and ""네이밍"" (naming). Since the user has searched for ""공모전"" a significant number of times (18), it strongly indicates that the user is interested in it. The presence of ""네이밍"" in the new announcement may be less relevant to the user's previous searches, but the strong affinity for ""공모전"" makes it highly likely that the user has an interest in the new announcement.

Although the user has explored the keyword ""contest,"" which correlates with the new notice, the lack of searches for ""planning"" and ""AI"" indicates less interest in those aspects.

Given this mix of focus and the interest in the contest keyword, it suggests that the user may have some curiosity about the new notice, aligning with a potential interest rating of 1. However, since there's a strong leaning towards ""COVID-19,"" it's not entirely conclusive. Therefore, the user's interest in the new notice could be marked as uncertain due to the uneven keyword distribution.",1
205,"Based on the given information, the user's target score is 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement. The keywords for the new announcement are ""student engagement"" and ""extracurricular programs."" However, the user's search history shows a predominant interest in tags such as ""7times of server"" (7 times), ""7times of AI"" (7 times), ""programming"" (5 times), and ""security"" (4 times), among others, but does not include any reference to ""student engagement"" or ""extracurricular programs."" 

Since the user's recent searches mainly focus on technical and job-related topics, while the new announcements cater to a different area involving student activities, it is logical to conclude that the user is not interested in the newly announced information.",0
206,"Based on the given information, the new announcement's keyword is ""planning."" The user's notice search history includes the tags ""meeting"" (28 times) and ""supporters"" (22 times). Considering that the keyword ""planning"" does not directly relate to the user's previous searches for ""meeting"" and ""supporters,"" it suggests that the user may not have a clear interest in this new announcement. The lack of any searches related to the keyword ""planning"" makes it challenging to determine their interest level, leading to the conclusion that the user is likely not interested in the announcement, which corresponds to a target score of 0.",0
207,"Based on the given information, the user has shown interest in several different tags related to notices, such as ""Mentoring,"" ""Participants,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Education,"" ""Application Method,"" ""Content Creation,"" ""Submission Period,"" ""Planning,"" and ""Education Program."" 

With the new notice key tags being ""Youth Program,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Education,"" we can analyze the user's search records. The user searched for ""Mentoring"" 7 times, ""Lecture"" 3 times, and ""Education"" 6 times. This indicates a clear pattern of interest in the tags that align with the new notice.

Since the user’s interest in ""Mentoring"" is notably high with 7 searches, and they also showed interest in ""Lecture"" and ""Education,"" which are part of the new notice keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely to be interested in the new notice. Therefore, the target score of 1, indicating interest, makes sense given the user's search history.",1

The user searched for ""education"" 12 times, ""lecture"" 7 times, and other related terms like ""student participation"" and ""mentoring"" at least a few times, indicating a strong interest in educational and participatory activities. 

The new announcement contains keywords such as ""club,"" ""meeting,"" ""college student participation,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" ""volunteering,"" and ""education."" Given that ""education"" and ""lecture"" are significant keywords in both the user's search history and the new announcement, it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement. The user's consistent search for ""education"" and ""lecture"" aligns well with the relevant keywords, supporting the conclusion that they might find the new announcement appealing.

Therefore, based on this analysis, it suggests that the user may be interested in the new notice about these topics, aligning with the target score of 1.",1
209,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for the keywords ""Planning"" (기획) 33 times and ""Competition"" (공모전) 17 times in their notification search history.

The user's search history shows strong interest, with the following relevant keywords: ""Planning"" was searched 5 times, and ""Contest"" was searched 8 times. This indicates that the user has actively engaged with both of the keywords associated with the new announcement. Given the frequent searches for the keywords related to the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in this announcement. Therefore, the predicted score is 1 (indicating interest).",0

The new notice contains the keywords ""planning,"" ""contest,"" and ""inquiry."" 

Given that the user has searched for ""planning"" 15 times and ""contest"" 13 times, this suggests a clear interest in both of these topics. The absence of searches for ""inquiry"" does not detract from the interest in the other two keywords. 

Since both relevant tags from the new notice were frequently searched by the user, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely interested in this new notice. Therefore, the target score of 1 seems appropriate, indicating that the user probably has an interest in the new announcement.",1

The new notice includes the keywords ""접수방법"" (Submission Method), ""기획"" (Planning), and ""공모전"" (Competition). 

Since the user has searched for ""공모전"" 17 times, this suggests that they have a high level of interest in competitions, which directly aligns with the keyword from the new notice. The search for ""접수방법"" and ""기획"" is not reflected in the user’s history, making it unclear how much interest there is in those specific aspects. However, given the prominent interest in ""공모전,"" it can be inferred that the user would likely find the new notice relevant.

Among these, ""education"" overlaps with the user's search history.

Although ""internship"" was not directly searched, the high interest in ""education"" suggests a potential inclination towards related topics, including internship opportunities. 

The user’s extensive search history for educational content indicates a strong engagement with this area, reinforcing the likelihood that they would also be interested in potential internship opportunities associated with educational programs. Given this pattern, it appears that the user has an interest in the new announcement, aligning with the target score of 0.",0
215,"Based on the given information, the target score is 0, indicating that the user is not interested in the new announcement. The keyword information for the new notice does not contain any significant tags, which means it lacks relevant topics that may capture the user's attention.

While these keywords show that the user has a diverse range of interests, the absence of relevant keywords in the new announcement suggests there is no alignment with the user's established interests.

Thus, the lack of connection between the user's past search behavior and the content of the new announcement supports the conclusion that the user is likely not interested in this particular notice, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

The user has shown a significant interest in ""lecture"" by searching for it 8 times and ""mentoring"" 7 times. Additionally, they have also searched for ""education"" 4 times.

The new announcement, however, does not contain any significant keywords. This lack of relevant keywords makes it difficult to determine whether the user will be interested in this announcement.

The new announcement includes keywords such as ""education program,"" ""education process,"" ""lecture,"" ""AI education,"" ""free education,"" and ""mentoring.""

Although the user has searched for ""education"" multiple times, the overall focus seems to be directed towards specific events or qualifications rather than general educational content.

The user has searched for the keyword 'education' 10 times and 'lecture' 6 times. This indicates a significant interest in both keywords relevant to the new notification.

The user has searched for ""video"" 11 times, ""job support"" 9 times, ""design"" 9 times, ""others"" 6 times, ""education program"" 5 times, ""graduate student"" 5 times, and ""recruitment information"" 5 times.

While the keyword ""education program"" appears in the user's search history with 5 mentions, the presence of the other tags suggests that their main focus is elsewhere, particularly on ""video,"" ""job support,"" and ""design."" Additionally, the keyword ""student participation"" is not reflected in the user's search history at all, which further indicates a lack of interest in the new announcement's focus. Overall, given this information, we can conclude that the user is likely not interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

The new announcement's keywords include ""education,"" ""employment,"" and ""bootcamp."" 

Since ""education"" is a keyword in both the user's search history and the new announcement, and it has been searched the most frequently (24 times), it suggests a strong interest in topics related to education. Furthermore, while the user has not searched for the keywords ""employment"" and ""bootcamp,"" the substantial engagement with educational topics implies that the user may still show interest in these related areas, especially if they connect to their existing interests.

Thus, with the prevalent interest indicated through the searches, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, leading to a predicted goal score of 1.",1

The dominant interests in their search history show a focus on areas such as ""Education"" (9 times) and ""Thesis"" (6 times), along with various other topics, but none of the searches are directly related to the new announcement's keywords.

The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""server"" 9 times and ""cloud"" 8 times. This suggests a strong interest in both keywords.

254,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows that they have searched for the tags ""education"" 28 times and ""lecture"" 22 times. The new announcement contains the keywords ""education"" and ""target audience.""

Given the extensive search history related to ""education,"" it suggests a strong interest in this topic. Although the user has not searched for ""target audience,"" the frequent engagement with the tag ""education"" indicates that the user is likely to be interested in announcements related to this field. Therefore, the user's interest appears to align positively with the new announcement's keywords, suggesting a likelihood of a score of 1 (indicating interest).",1

The user has searched for ""교육"" 28 times and ""강연"" (lecture) 22 times in their recent 50 announcement search history.

The significant frequency of the search for ""교육"" suggests a strong interest in educational topics. Although ""강연"" is not a keyword in the new announcement, the fact that ""교육"" corresponds to a keyword indicates the user may have a vested interest in related subjects. Therefore, the combination of frequently searching for ""교육"" and the absence of conflicting interests supports the conclusion that the user is indeed interested in the new announcement, aligning with the goal score of 1.",1

Since the user has searched for ""lecture"" and ""free education,"" both of which are directly aligned with the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user may have a considerable interest in this new announcement. The frequent searches for ""education"" also indicate an overall interest in the topic, which further supports the idea that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the likely score for their interest would be 1.",1

The new announcement has keywords related to employment, competitions, and internships. Since the user has searched for the tag ""competitions"" 6 times, there is a clear interest in this area. However, the tags ""employment"" and ""internships"" were not part of the user's search history, which makes it unclear whether the user is interested in these particular topics. 

Therefore, considering the strong interest in the ""competitions"" tag but the absence of interest in the other two keywords, it seems the user may have some interest in the new announcement, but it's not definitive given the lack of searches for ""employment"" and ""internships."" Thus, they are likely to be rated a 0 for strong interest, as there is only limited relevance observed.",0

The significant frequency of searches for both ""contest"" and ""poster"" suggests that the user is quite interested in topics related to these keywords. With 18 searches for ""contest"" alone, it is evident that the user has a strong inclination towards this theme. The fact that both relevant keywords show a substantial number of searches further supports the likelihood that the user is interested in the new notice.

Therefore, considering the search history aligned with the new notice keywords, it can be logically concluded that the user has an interest in this notice, which corresponds to the target score of 1.",1
259,"Based on the given information, the user's target score is 1, indicating that they are interested in the new announcement. The new announcement has keywords such as ""lecture,"" ""content creation,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" and ""application method."" 

The user's search history reflects considerable engagement with the keywords ""education"" (28 times) and ""lecture"" (22 times). This heavy frequency of searching for both ""education"" and ""lecture"" suggests a strong interest in these topics. Since the new announcement contains both of these keywords, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement due to their consistent searching behavior related to keywords that directly match those of the announcement. Therefore, the model can confidently rate this scenario with a target score of 1.",1

While the user did not search for ""Training Schedule"" specifically, they have shown a significant interest in ""Job Support,"" as evidenced by their searches related to it. Given that they have searched for ""Job Support"" 4 times, it indicates a clear interest in this topic. However, the absence of searches for ""Training Schedule"" leaves some uncertainty regarding their interest in that specific aspect of the announcement. 

Overall, since the user has shown strong interest in ""Job Support,"" the likelihood that they are interested in the new announcement (which includes this keyword) leans towards a positive indication. Hence, the goal score of 1 seems appropriate in this case.",0

Given that the new announcement includes the keywords ""education"" and ""employment,"" it is reasonable to assume that the user may have an interest in the new announcement. The significant amount of searches specifically for ""education"" indicates a strong interest in that area, while the searches for ""employment"" also suggest relevance. However, since the user did not search for ""employment"" as frequently as ""education,"" their interest in employment-related aspects may be comparatively weaker. Nevertheless, the overall search behavior indicates a likely interest in the announcement, supporting the notion of a positive engagement with the content.

Since there are no matching keywords in the user's search history related to ""Application Guide"" or ""Education,"" it suggests that the user may not have a particular interest in the new announcement. The focus on ""Student Participation"" does not indicate engagement with the newly presented keywords, which leads us to conclude that the user is likely not interested in this announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

The absence of relevant searches for the new announcement's keywords indicates that the user likely has little to no interest in this announcement, as none of the topics searched in the past resonate with the current tags.

Given that the user has searched for ""supporters"" 10 times and ""press group"" 11 times, there is a clear interest in the relevant tags present in the new announcement. Although the user has shown greater interest in ""education,"" the frequency of searches for ""supporters"" and ""press group"" indicates that they are likely attentive to the new announcement.

The inclusion of these keywords suggests that the user may find the information relevant and engaging, supporting the conclusion that their interest is likely present. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign a score of 1 indicating that the user is interested in the new announcement.",1

The user has searched for keywords such as ""education"" (9 times), ""thesis"" (6 times), ""inquiries"" (4 times), ""graduate students"" (4 times), ""employment"" (4 times), ""events"" (3 times), and others related to academic and professional queries. Since there is no overlap between the user's search history and the new notice's keywords, it is likely that the user does not have an interest in this notice.

While ""event"" appears in both the user's search history and the new announcement, it's worth noting that other related terms do not directly correspond to the new keywords of ""event"" and ""thesis."" 

Overall, since the user has primarily focused on different subjects that do not align with the specific keywords of the new announcement and has not demonstrated a clear interest in ""thesis"" at all, it supports the conclusion that the user is not interested in the new announcement.

Since the user has searched for ""Contest"" 17 times, this suggests a significant interest in related announcements. While ""Design"" was not searched directly, the extensive interest in ""Contest"" indicates a likelihood that the user would be interested in a contest that might involve design elements. Therefore, based on the strong interest in the ""Contest"" keyword, we could conclude that the user is likely to have interest in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1
296,"Based on the given information, the user has not shown interest in the new announcement as indicated by a target score of 0. The new announcement includes keywords ""Contact"" and ""Backend."" However, the user's search history predominantly features keywords related to ""Education"" (12 times), ""2024 Academic Year"" (10 times), ""Application Eligibility"" (10 times), ""Winter Semester"" (9 times), and ""Scholarships"" (9 times). 

Since there are no searches related to the keywords ""Contact"" and ""Backend,"" this suggests a lack of interest in the new announcement.

297,"Based on the given information, the new announcement has the keywords: free education, design, online education, content creation, and video. The user's recent search history includes the following keyword tags with their corresponding search counts: design (22 times), planning (10 times), event (6 times), thesis (6 times), and contest (6 times).

Since the user has shown significant interest in the ""design"" tag by searching for it 22 times, and ""free education"" can be related to content creation in an educational context, there is a likelihood that the user may be interested in the new announcement due to the overlap with their prominent search history. Although the user has not explicitly searched for ""free education,"" the presence of related interest in ""design"" makes it more probable that they would be engaged in the new announcement.

Given this information, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. Thus, the target score of 1 indicates that the user is interested.",1

Since the user's search history does not include any queries related to ""application guide"" or ""seminar"", it indicates a lack of interest in the new notice. The fact that the user has searched extensively in other areas but has not shown any relevant searches related to the new notice's keywords suggests they are unlikely to be interested in this particular announcement.

However, the new notice contains keywords related to Education, Marketing, and Employment. 

While the user has searched for the tag 'Education' 6 times, which shows some level of interest, the tags 'Marketing' and 'Employment' were not mentioned in the user's search history at all.

In the user's search history, they have searched for keywords related to education and development, such as Backend (5 times), Frontend (5 times), Web Development (3 times), Government Support (2 times), and Employment Support (1 time). However, the frequency of the searches for Backend and Frontend suggests some level of interest in general development and employment areas.

Despite this, since the user's interest does not translate effectively to the specific new announcement's keywords, particularly with only one recorded search for Employment Support, it can be concluded that the user likely does not find enough relevance in the new announcement to warrant engagement, leading to the determination that they are not interested (rating of 0).",0

The new notice has ""Naming"" as its keyword. Since there is no direct connection between ""Naming"" and the keywords the user frequently searched for, it indicates that the user may not have a particular interest in this new notice.

The new announcement, however, contains keywords ""event"" and ""education."" There is no indication in the user's search history that suggests an interest in these topics. Instead, the keywords reflect a focus on job-related information and contractual matters.

The user's consistent interest in ""Competition,"" with 5 searches, suggests a clear engagement with this topic. Furthermore, while ""Planning"" has only been searched 2 times, it still indicates some level of interest. Since both keywords are part of the user's search history, it implies that the user likely has a positive inclination towards the new announcement, indicating an interest level of 1.

Since the user has already searched for ""education"" significantly, it suggests that they are likely interested in the new notice. However, there is no record of the user searching for the ""club"" tag, leaving that interest ambiguous.

While the user has shown significant interest in the ""mentoring"" and ""event"" tags, which are also part of the new announcement’s keywords, the overall trend of their search history does not sufficiently match the remaining keywords such as education, exhibition, and festival.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the ""design"" keyword by searching it 22 times and has also searched for ""planning"" 10 times, it suggests a strong inclination towards both areas of interest.

Since the user demonstrated a significant interest in ""education"" with 24 searches, it suggests a strong likelihood that they are interested in the new notice, especially because ""education"" is a direct match to one of the keywords in the new notice. Although the other keywords in the notice haven't been searched, the high frequency of interest in the related topic indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the notice overall.

The user's recent search history shows a significant interest in ""Education"" (10 times), ""Employment"" (7 times), ""Youth"" (6 times), and ""Internship"" (6 times), among others. 

Given that the user has searched for ""Education"" multiple times and the new notice includes this keyword, it suggests that the user is quite interested in educational opportunities.

The absence of searches related to ""education,"" ""employment,"" or ""intern"" suggests that the user does not have a strong interest in these topics.

Given that there is no direct match between the keywords in the user's search history and the new notification keywords, it is difficult to ascertain a strong interest in the new announcement. Although the user may have a general interest in technology-related subjects, specifically in areas such as AI and cloud, the absence of searches related to ""backend"" or ""web development"" suggests that the user is likely not interested in this particular notification.

Thus, the user likely has a score of 0 for their interest in this new announcement.",0
332,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows that they searched the keyword tags related to various events, such as ""event"" 9 times, ""image"" 7 times, and ""education"" 5 times.

Although the user has shown some interest in the tag ""education,"" the other two tags, ""trade"" and ""management,"" do not appear in their search history at all. 

This indicates that the user's overall level of interest might be limited, and since only one of the three keywords matches their search behavior, we cannot conclusively determine strong interest in the new announcement as a whole. Therefore, it seems that the user's interest in the new announcement is uncertain, leading us to conclude the target score as 0, indicating that they may not be interested in this announcement.",0

The new notice has the keywords ""AI"" and ""Curriculum."" 

Since the user has shown significant interest in ""AI"" with 15 searches, it indicates a strong likelihood that they would be interested in the new notice as well. Additionally, their 8 searches for ""Curriculum"" further support the notion that they are likely to engage with this new information.

Given this evidence, it can be logically concluded that the user is interested in the new notice, corresponding to the value of 1 for the target score.",1

While there is a significant interest in ""Supporters,"" as indicated by the 22 searches, the term ""Press Corps"" does not appear in the user's search history. The heavy focus on ""Supporters"" suggests that the user may have a strong interest in related announcements.

Since the keyword ""AI"" is entirely absent from the user's search record, it indicates that the user has not shown any interest in this area. Therefore, we can conclude that the likelihood of this user being interested in the new announcement related to ""AI"" is low, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

Since ""recruitment"" does not appear anywhere in their search records, it suggests that the user is not particularly interested in this announcement.

However, the new announcement's keywords are simply ""education"" and ""employment."" 

Though the user has not searched exactly for these keywords, their frequent searches for related terms suggest a general interest in this domain. The user’s extensive search history demonstrates a tendency toward seeking out information linked to job preparation and educational opportunities, making it reasonable to conclude that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement. 

Therefore, the target score of 1 indicates that the user may indeed have an interest in the announcement, as their previous searches align closely with its focus on education and employment.",0

Since the user searched for ""Education"" 24 times, it indicates a strong interest in this topic. Although the other keywords from the new announcement (""Youth Program,"" ""Lecture,"" and ""Mentoring"") were not directly found in the user's search history, the significant interest in ""Education"" suggests that the user may also have an inclination toward related areas, such as educational programs or events.

However, reviewing the user's recent search history reveals that they have not searched for any of these keywords. The most frequently searched tags include ""Backend"" (6 times), ""Employment"" (5 times), and ""Cloud"" (4 times), among others.

Given that the user has shown considerable interest in topics related to employment and back-end development, it seems they might not have an interest in the new announcement related to supporters and press corps at all.

However, the new notice's keywords are ""Event"" and ""Occasion."" There is no overlap between the user's previous search records and the new notice keywords. This lack of relevant searches indicates that the user does not show an interest in the new notice's content.

The user's search history shows they searched for the keyword ""contest"" 17 times, which indicates a strong interest in that area. Additionally, while ""planning"" has not been specifically mentioned in the user's search records, the high frequency of interest in related tags such as ""contest"" suggests that the user is likely interested in announcements related to contests. 

Given the strong interest in ""contest"" and the general interest in student participation from other tags, it can be inferred that the user is interested in the new announcement. Thus, the target score is 1, indicating the user's interest in the announcement.",1
344,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history indicates a notable interest in various related topics. The user has searched for ""competition"" (공모전) a total of 18 times, which shows strong interest in this area. Additionally, ""UCC"" was searched 11 times, suggesting a moderate interest. However, there are no searches related to ""eligibility"" (참가자격), which is key for understanding participation in competitions.

Given that the new notice contains the keywords ""competition"" and ""eligibility,"" the frequent searches for ""competition"" imply that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. The lack of searches related to ""eligibility"" makes it less clear if they recognize the importance of that aspect, but the strong interest in competitions overall suggests that the user would likely not overlook an opportunity aligned with their interests.

Therefore, the likelihood of the user showing interest in the new notice is high, justifying the ""goal rating"" of 1.",1

The user's search history shows a significant interest in ""education"" and ""lecture,"" as they have searched ""education"" 10 times and ""lecture"" 5 times. This indicates a strong inclination towards learning and informational opportunities. Additionally, the keyword ""mentoring,"" which the user has also searched (4 times), aligns well with the new announcement's keywords.

Considering this, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement given that the key topics of free training, lectures, and mentoring directly relate to their previous searches. Therefore, the goal score of 1 (indicating interest) appears justified based on the relevant keyword matches.",1

Given that the user has shown a significant interest in the keyword ""Supporters"" by searching for it 19 times, it indicates a strong inclination towards content related to this topic. Furthermore, the user's interest in ""Application Method,"" which they have searched 8 times, suggests they are also curious about how to apply for opportunities related to this keyword. 

Considering this evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement that contains both ""Supporters"" and ""Application Method,"" thus leading to the target score of 1.",1

Looking at the user's search history, they have extensively searched for keywords such as Education (12 times), Events (7 times), AI (6 times), Employment (4 times), and Mentoring (3 times), among others. Notably, while there is some overlap with the ""AI"" tag (which the user searched for 6 times), the other keywords from the new notice do not match the user’s search history.

This discrepancy indicates that the user likely does not have a significant interest in the new notice as their search history primarily reflects a focus on different aspects of education, events, and employment support, rather than the more technical topics included in the new notice's tags. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user does not express strong interest in the new notice based on the provided information.",0

Among the new keywords, ""Mentoring Program"" is the only relevant tag found in the user's search history, and it was searched only 5 times. This low frequency suggests that while the user might have some interest in mentoring, it is not strong enough to indicate a significant interest in the new announcement as a whole.

The user has searched for tags such as ""start-up,"" ""intern,"" ""education,"" ""employment,"" ""mentoring,"" ""job postings,"" ""marketing,"" ""lecture,"" ""application method,"" and ""mentoring program,"" focusing on general career development and educational opportunities. However, their search history does not contain any references to ""competition"" or ""UCC."" 

Since there is a clear absence of interest in these specific keywords within the user's 50 search records, it is logical to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score remains 0.",0
372,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes the keywords ""planning"" and ""contest."" The user's search history indicates strong engagement with the keyword ""planning,"" which has been searched 14 times, as well as ""contest,"" searched 7 times. This suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, particularly since they have actively searched for related keywords multiple times. Therefore, given the user's active interest in these keywords, it seems reasonable to conclude that they would have an interest in this announcement, leading to a target score of 1.",1
373,"Based on the given information, the user has shown an interest in the keywords related to ""meeting"" (모임) with 28 searches and ""supporters"" (서포터즈) with 22 searches in their recent notification records.

Considering that the user has conducted a significant number of searches for both ""meeting"" and ""supporters,"" which are also present in the new notification's keyword list, it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in this new notice. The frequency of searches for these keywords indicates a solid interest in the topics, leading to the conclusion of a score of 1 (indicating interest).",1
374,"Based on the given information, the user has shown no interest in the new announcement keywords ""academic exchange"" and ""current student"" since their search history indicates a lack of related tags. The user has searched for club-related and mentoring tags multiple times, such as ""club"" (7 times) and ""mentoring"" (7 times), but there are no searches related to academic activities or student affairs. This disinterest suggests a goal score of 0, meaning the user is unlikely to be interested in the new announcement.",0
375,"Based on the given information, the new announcement has the keyword ""Contest."" The user's search history indicates that they have searched for the keyword ""Planning"" 33 times and ""Contest"" 17 times. The significant number of searches for both keywords suggests the user has a keen interest in these topics. 

While they have searched for ""Contest"" 17 times, which directly corresponds to the announcement's keyword, the higher frequency of the keyword ""Planning"" shows that the user is actively engaged with the theme, even though it is not directly related to the current announcement. 

Overall, the combination of these factors leads us to infer that the user is likely interested in the new announcement about the ""Contest,"" as indicated by the engagement with the relevant keyword. Therefore, the target score is 1, indicating interest.",1
376,"Based on the given information, the user's interest level in the new announcement can be assessed as low. The new announcement contains no significant keywords, which indicates that it may not catch the user's attention.

However, since there are no relevant keywords in the new announcement, it suggests that the user may not find the announcement appealing.

Despite several tags being searched, without corresponding keywords in the announcement, it's reasonable to conclude that the user does not have a strong interest in this particular notice, justifying the target score of 0.",0
377,"Based on the given information, the user has a goal score of 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement. The new announcement contains the keywords ""행사"" (event) and ""event."" However, when we examine the user's search history, we notice that the user has not shown significant interest in these keywords. 

The user searched for ""event"" only 2 times and did not show any engagement with related or synonymous keywords concerning events. In contrast, the user's history reveals stronger interests in other topics, such as ""기획"" (planning) with 6 searches, ""교육비 지원"" (educational support) with 5 searches, and ""공모전"" (contest) with 4 searches. This demonstrates that the user is more inclined towards topics related to planning and education rather than events. 

Thus, given the absence of substantial interest in the keywords related to the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not interested in the announcement.",0
378,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates they have shown significant interest in the following keywords: ""COVID-19"" (31 times) and ""Contest"" (19 times). Looking at the new announcement's keywords, which are ""Target Participants,"" ""Contest,"" and ""UCC,"" we can infer a logical conclusion about the user's potential interest in the new announcement.

The keyword ""Contest"" is directly relevant to the user's search history, where it appears 19 times. This suggests a moderate interest in contests, supporting the idea that the user may likely find the new announcement relevant and intriguing.

However, the keywords ""Target Participants"" and ""UCC"" do not appear to be part of the user's recent searches. This lack of interest in these respective keywords makes the overall conclusion somewhat nuanced. While the strong presence of the ""Contest"" keyword implies some level of interest, the absence of search activity concerning the other two keywords may diminish the overall likelihood of a strong interest.

Given that the user has shown a significant inclination towards the ""Contest"" keyword, we can deduce that they are interested in the new announcement to some extent. Therefore, it seems that the output target score of 1 (indicating interest) is supported by the user's existing engagement with similar content.",1
379,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""education"" and ""lecture."" The user's search history indicates they have searched for ""lecture"" 9 times and ""education"" 8 times.

The new announcement contains the keywords ""education"" and ""lecture."" Given that the user has frequently searched for ""lecture"" (10 times) and has also shown interest in ""education"" (6 times), it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in this new announcement. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that the user has a positive inclination towards the announcement, which supports the target score of 1.",1

However, the user's search history shows no related searches for these keywords. Instead, the user has looked for ""contest"" 50 times, which does not align with the new announcement's focus.

Additionally, looking at the user's search history, it reflects a diverse range of interests, including tags related to AI, online education, cybersecurity, and various training programs, with multiple searches for each keyword. However, since there are no relevant keywords associated with the new announcement, it seems that the user may not find the information appealing and thus has shown no interest.",0
383,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes the keywords ""education,"" ""employment,"" and ""internship."" The user's search history shows that they have searched for the tag ""education"" 28 times and the tag ""lecture"" 22 times. Since ""education"" is present in both the new announcement's keywords and the user's search history, it indicates a strong interest in this topic. The user's frequent search for ""education"" suggests that they are quite engaged with this area.

Although ""lecture"" has been searched for 22 times, it does not directly match any of the new announcement's keywords. However, the significant interest in ""education"" implies that the user may also be interested in related topics, such as ""employment"" or ""internship,"" which could be associated with educational activities. Overall, the notable frequency of the ""education"" keyword makes it reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, leading to the target score of 1.",1

However, the new announcement contains keywords ""Student Support"" and ""Application Method,"" which are not reflected in the user's recent search history.

Given that the user has a strong interest in ""education"" and has searched for it 23 times, it indicates a significant level of interest in this keyword. While the searches for ""lectures"" and ""free education"" are also notable, the prominent interest in ""education"" suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, particularly since ""education"" is one of the keywords. 

Additionally, although the other keywords, ""employment"" and ""internships,"" have not been specifically searched for, the overarching theme of ""education"" could be associated with those keywords as they often relate to opportunities and learning environments. Therefore, it appears that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, leading me to conclude a target score of 1 reflects this interest.",1
387,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""education,"" ""employment,"" and ""internship."" However, the user's recent search history indicates that they have not specifically searched for these keywords directly. 

The user has frequently searched for related topics such as ""training incentives,"" ""employment support,"" and ""job training,"" which shows a general interest in employment-related themes. However, while there may be an indirect connection to the new notice's keywords, there are no direct searches for ""education,"" ""employment,"" or ""internship"" found within the user's search history. 

Therefore, since the user has shown some interest in employment aspects but none for the specific new notice keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely not interested in this new notice, leading to a target score of 0.",0
388,"Based on the given information, the user has a goal score of 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement. The new announcement's keywords include big data, server, Java, Python, security, government funding, free education, AI, IT training, cloud, mentoring, job connections, and programming. 

Looking at the user's search history, they have made the following keyword searches: they searched for ""server"" 3 times and ""security"" 1 time. However, the other relevant keywords from the new announcement, such as big data, Java, Python, government funding, free education, AI, IT training, cloud, mentoring, job connections, and programming, do not appear in their search history at all. 

Given that the user has shown limited interest specifically in only ""server,"" which is not a strong indicator of overall interest in the new announcement, and the absence of searches related to the other crucial keywords, it seems that the user is not inclined to engage with this new announcement. Thus, the lack of frequency and diversity in relevant keyword searches logically supports the conclusion that the user is unlikely to be interested in the announcement, leading us to a final judgment of 0.",0

The user's search history indicates that they have searched for the keyword ""Planning"" 14 times and ""Contest"" 7 times. 

This strong interest in ""Planning"" and the moderate interest in ""Contest"" suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement since two of the keywords directly align with their previous search behavior. In contrast, the keyword ""Youth"" does not appear in the user's search history, indicating no prior interest in that specific area. 

Overall, the user's search patterns for ""Planning"" and ""Contest"" support the conclusion that they are interested in the new announcement, so the target score is 1.",1

While the user has searched for ""Korea Aerospace University"" multiple times, which is also a keyword in the new announcement, the majority of their search history revolves around different themes, specifically competitions and lectures. This inconsistency suggests a lack of strong interest in the specific topics related to the new announcement's keywords. 

Therefore, despite the presence of ""Korea Aerospace University"" in their search history, the overall lack of frequency in relevant searches for the remaining keywords indicates that the user is not likely to be particularly interested in the announcement, leading to a target score of 0.",0

Despite having recorded search activity for various tags such as ""contest"" (11 times), ""lecture"" (10 times), ""design"" (9 times), ""Korean Aerospace University"" (8 times), ""recruitment"" (6 times), and ""education"" (6 times), the absence of focused keywords in the new notice makes it difficult to determine the user's level of interest definitively. 

Given the lack of keywords in the new announcement, it is ambiguous whether the user will find the notice interesting or not. Hence, this situation corresponds to a prediction of 0, suggesting that the user is unlikely to show interest in the new notice.",0

Given that the user has shown a significant interest in the keyword ""Education"" by searching for it 11 times, and also expressed some interest in ""Employment"" with 6 searches, it indicates that the user may indeed have an interest in the new notice. The absence of searches related to ""Youth"" is notable, but the strong engagement with the other two keywords suggests a positive inclination towards the content of the notice, implying a likely interest.

Consequently, with the evidence that aligns with the user's engagement towards the relevant keywords, the target score for this scenario would be 1, signifying that the user is interested in the new notice.",1
393,"Based on the given information, the user's ""notice search history"" shows a significant interest in the keyword ""서포터즈,"" which they searched for 26 times, indicating a strong engagement with this topic. The keyword ""지원 방법"" from the new notice is somewhat ambiguous since there are no specific search records related to this term, suggesting that the user may not have demonstrated interest in the specifics of the application process. 

Considering the overall context, the user has expressed clear interest in ""서포터즈"", which is also a part of the new notice’s keywords. This correlation implies that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice, resulting in a positive scoring of 1.

The new announcement contains the keywords ""game,"" ""competition,"" and ""essay."" Since the keyword ""competition"" directly relates to ""공모전,"" it is reasonable to conclude that the user might be interested in the announcement, leading to a positive score of 1.

Therefore, since the user exhibits significant interest in education-related topics but only minimal interest in employment, the likelihood of them being interested in the new announcement, which focuses on both keywords, is ambiguous.

There is no direct match between the new notice keywords and the user's search history.

Thus, the user's engagement with the new notice could be interpreted as moderately positive, but it is important to note that their overall interest seems to lean towards a wider range of topics. Therefore, the model's prediction may suggest that the target score could be a 0, indicating less likelihood of strong interest in this specific notice.",0

However, the new announcement contains keywords ""Microdegree"" and ""Educational Program."" There is no mention of either ""Microdegree"" or ""Educational Program"" in the user's previous search records. While the user has shown a general interest in educational content based on their search history, the specific tags of the new announcement do not align with their recent searches.

Given that the user has searched for ""education"" and ""mentoring"" multiple times (4 times each) and has shown significant interest in ""lecture"" (8 times), it can be inferred that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, particularly due to the relevant keywords present.

Given that the search history does not include any direct references to ""graduate student,"" it appears that the user has not shown an interest in this specific topic.

The user's recent search activities show no searches related to the keywords ""Education"" or ""Lecture."" As a result, this lack of connection between the user's previous interests and the new notice's keywords suggests that the user is unlikely to find the notice relevant or appealing.

This indicates that while the user has an active interest in various activities, none of the search keywords directly align with the new announcement's keywords, which are focused on educational and student engagement opportunities. Thus, even though the user seems to engage in related themes such as events and gatherings, the absence of overlapping keywords suggests a lack of specific interest in the new announcement.

Given that the user's previous search history does not include any tags related to the new announcement's keywords, it's likely that the user does not have a strong interest in the new announcement. The parameters for ""Job Support,"" ""Recruitment,"" ""Backend,"" ""Curriculum,"" ""Frontend,"" and ""Training Incentives"" differ significantly from the user's past searches, which center around support and media-related tags. Thus, the likelihood of the user being interested in this new announcement appears low, aligning with the objective score of 0.",0

None of the keywords from the new announcement match the user's search history, which raises doubt about their interest in the announcement. The user has not searched for anything related to ""credit exchange"" or ""2024 academic year,"" indicating that they likely do not find these topics relevant to their interests.

The user's searches do not directly align with the new notice's keywords. There are no relevant tags related to ""credit exchange"" or ""educational program"" in the user's search history. This suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in the new notice, leading to the target score of 0, indicating disinterest.

This disconnect suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in the new notice as it features entirely different topics compared to their previously searched keywords.

The high frequency of searches for the keywords related to the new announcement suggests that the user is indeed interested in these topics.

Additionally, ""취업"" (employment) is another keyword that appears in the new notice and has also been searched 3 times by the user, suggesting a potential interest in job-related announcements.

Given that the user has engaged with key tags that directly correspond to the new notice's keywords, it strongly indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

Although ""design"" and ""university students"" are new keywords that the user has not specifically searched for, the presence of ""education,"" ""lectures,"" and ""mentoring"" in the new announcement suggests a strong likelihood of interest.

The absence of relevant keywords in the new announcement makes it ambiguous whether the user is interested in this specific notice.

However, the user's search history reveals that they have only searched for ""COVID-19"" 50 times.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

Given that the user has shown significant interest in ""Cloud"" with 12 searches, and has also searched for ""Server"" 5 times, it suggests that the user likely has a keen interest in the new announcement. While the interests in ""Security,"" ""Employment Support,"" ""Free Education,"" ""Backend,"" and ""Frontend"" are also present, the strong search frequency for ""Cloud"" and the moderate interest in ""Server"" indicate that the user is indeed interested in the announcement. Therefore, the target score would be 1.",1
459,"Based on the given information, the target score is 0, indicating that the user is not interested in the new announcement.

However, the user's search history shows a strong focus on tags such as ""government support"" (8 times), ""backend"" (6 times), and ""programming"" (5 times), among others. 

None of the tags in the user's recent search history align with the tags of the new announcement. This absence of overlap between the topics the user is researching and those included in the new announcement suggests a lack of interest in the newly presented information. The notable distance between the search interests and the announcement keywords leads to the conclusion that the user is likely not inclined to engage with the new announcement, reinforcing the target score of 0.",0
460,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords ""Supporters,"" ""Application Method,"" and ""Journalists."" The user's search history shows 26 instances of ""Supporters"" and 24 instances of ""Journalists."" This indicates that the user has shown a significant interest in both ""Supporters"" and ""Journalists"" due to the high frequency of searches related to these keywords. Although there is no record of the ""Application Method"" keyword, the strong interest in the other two keywords suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, it can be inferred that the user is likely interested in the announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1
461,"Based on the given information, the user's recorded search history shows significant interest in ""Student Support"" with 18 searches, ""Contest"" with 17 searches, and ""Planning"" with 15 searches. The new announcement's keywords are ""Contest"" and ""Naming."" 

Considering that the user has searched for the ""Contest"" tag 17 times, it is reasonable to infer that they have an interest in content related to contests. However, the other keyword ""Naming"" has no occurrences in their search history. This leads to an ambiguous conclusion: while the user likely has a keen interest in the ""Contest"" aspect of the new announcement, their engagement with ""Naming"" is uncertain.

Thus, given the relevance of the ""Contest"" keyword to the user's past searches and the absence of connection with ""Naming,"" it suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, leading to a target score of 1.",1

The new notice contains the keywords ""youth program"", ""lecture"", ""mentoring"", and ""education"". 

Since the user has searched for ""education"" and ""lecture"" multiple times (18 and 11 respectively), it suggests a strong interest in related topics. Although ""youth program"" and ""mentoring"" have not been searched, the presence of recognized keywords like ""education"" and ""lecture"" strongly indicates that the user may find the new notice relevant.

Given that the user has not shown any interest in the keywords related to the new notice, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not interested in the new announcement.

The user's search history indicates that they have searched for ""club"" 5 times, ""meeting"" 6 times, and ""volunteer"" 5 times.

However, the user's search history reflects significant engagement with different tags: they searched for ""youth"" 11 times, ""education"" 10 times, ""contest"" 10 times, ""application period"" 10 times, and ""planning"" 9 times.

The absence of any related keywords in the user's search history concerning the new notice suggests that they have not shown any interest in the topics presented. Specifically, the user has not searched for keywords like employment, lecture, mentoring, or entrepreneurship, which implies that these areas do not capture their attention. 

Overall, the user's extensive searches on unrelated topics, combined with the absence of relevant queries about the new notice, logically leads us to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in this announcement and, therefore, the goal score of 0 is justified.",0

Given that the user has searched for ""scholarship"" 17 times, it indicates a notable level of interest in this topic. Although there are other keywords in their search history, the frequency of the ""scholarship"" searches suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice related to scholarships.

However, the user's recent search history shows significant interest in different keywords, such as ""career exploration"" (10 times), ""non-curricular programs"" (7 times), and ""university job center"" (7 times).

The search history does not contain any relevant keywords related to the new announcement, as the user's searches are predominantly focused on career exploration and student support services rather than web development or related fields.

470,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a total absence of interest in the new announcement, which only contains the keyword ""Backend.""

The user's records highlight a wide range of interests, including activities like ""Supporters"" (6 times), ""Contest"" (5 times), and ""Planning"" (4 times), but unfortunately, none of these correlate with the keyword of the new notice.

However, the tag ""취업"" (employment) has not been searched at all. 

Given this, it appears that the user is positively inclined towards notices related to ""접수방법"" and ""교육,"" as evidenced by the frequency with which they have previously looked up these topics. The absence of interest in ""취업"" leaves some uncertainty about the user's overall interest in the new notice; nonetheless, the strong engagement with the other two tags suggests a likelihood of interest.

The new notice has the keyword ""Career Exploration."" Given that the user has not searched for any keywords directly related to ""Career Exploration,"" it appears that there is no strong basis to conclude that the user is particularly interested in this new notice.

However, the keywords associated with the new announcement include ""big data,"" ""backend,"" ""free education,"" ""employment support,"" ""AI,"" and ""frontend."" These tags are quite different from the user's past searches, which are focused on recruitment and support-related activities. Since there is no overlap between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in this particular announcement. Hence, the target score of 0 accurately reflects the user's lack of interest.",0

This discrepancy highlights a lack of overlap between the user's previous interests and the new notice's keyword.

The frequency of searches suggests that the user is particularly interested in the ""scholarship"" category, as they have engaged with this keyword more than any other. Additionally, the user has also searched for ""university student"" multiple times, indicating a strong relevance to the new notice's keywords. 

Considering this information, it is logical to deduce that the user has a significant interest in the newly announced notice that includes the keywords provided. Therefore, the ""target score"" of 1 is justified based on their consistent search behavior aligning closely with the new keywords.",1

Although there are many other tags searched in their history, the consistent interest in ""education"" and ""lecture"" suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

Given that the user has searched for ""education"" significantly more than any other tag, it suggests a strong interest in this area.

While the user has shown substantial interest in fields related to technology and financial assistance (evidenced by multiple searches for ""Frontend,"" ""Backend,"" and ""National Scholarship"" tags), there is little to no overlap with the new notification keywords. This lack of relevant keywords in the user's past searches implies that the user may not find the new notification appealing.

Given that the user has not displayed an interest in ""Education,"" ""Inquiry,"" or ""Lecture"" based on search history, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement.

Since the user does not show any related searches for ""Contest"" and ""Thesis,"" it is reasonable to conclude they are likely not interested in this new announcement.

The absence of the keyword ""visual"" in the search records suggests that this aspect of the announcement may not resonate with the user's interests. The keyword ""education"" is present in the user's history but is somewhat overshadowed by the numerous other tags that have higher frequencies, indicating a preference for more specific topics. 

Thus, while there is some relevance to ""education,"" the lack of strong interest or frequent searches related to the specific keywords of the new announcement leads to the conclusion that the user is unlikely to be interested in this announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

The user has shown a significant number of searches in the following tags: ""course registration"" (18 times), ""image"" (13 times), ""notice"" (10 times), and ""security"" (9 times). However, the new announcement lacks any important keywords that relate to these tags. Since there are no relevant tags in the announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not likely to be interested in this new announcement, as there is nothing that aligns with their previous search history. Therefore, the target score of 0 indicates a lack of interest.",0

Given that the user frequently searched for the keywords ""education"" (10 times) and ""employment"" (9 times), it suggests a strong interest in these topics. While there is a considerable number of searches in unrelated keywords such as ""visual,"" the repeated searches for the related keywords indicate that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

Thus, the user's overall interest in the new announcement can be inferred as positive, indicating that they likely have an interest in the provided announcement (1).",1
506,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords such as Bootcamp, Server, Programming, Government Support, Security, Backend, Employment Support, Cloud, Frontend, Training Costs Support, and Portfolio.

The user also searched for related keywords like ""Frontend"" (6 times) and ""Portfolio Making"" (8 times).

Although the user's search history is not exclusively focused on the exact keywords present in the new announcement, the overlaps indicate a noteworthy level of interest. Specifically, the user's engagement with ""Bootcamp"" and ""Programming Education"" suggests they are likely to be interested in the new announcement, given that these areas are closely related to the relevant keywords provided.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the user is interested in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion that the expected target score is 1.",1

The high frequency of searches for the keywords ""education"" (18 times) and ""lecture"" (11 times) suggests that the user has a strong interest in these topics. Although the keyword ""curriculum"" was not specifically searched, the presence of ""education"" indicates a likely relevance since they are closely related. 

Given that the user has demonstrated considerable interest in both ""education"" and ""lecture,"" it can be inferred that they are likely to have interest in the new notice. Therefore, the user probably has a positive sentiment towards the notice, aligning with the target score of 1.",1
508,"Based on the given information, the user's recent notice search history indicates that they have shown interest in various keywords.

The new notice includes keywords such as ""bootcamp,"" ""employment,"" ""job support,"" ""government funding,"" ""blockchain,"" and ""training incentive.""

Considering the user's search behavior, their repeated searches for ""employment"" and ""government funding"" align closely with the new notice's keywords. Since they searched for ""employment"" 4 times, it suggests a notable interest in job-related topics. Additionally, ""government funding,"" which was searched 5 times, connects directly to the ""government funding"" keyword in the new notice. This indicates that the user might be actively seeking opportunities related to financial support for education or training.

However, the user has not searched for ""bootcamp,"" ""blockchain,"" or ""training incentive,"" which might indicate a lack of interest in those specific areas. Overall, the search records suggest that the user is likely interested in the new notice due to their previous searches for related keywords.

509,"Based on the given information, the user's interest level can be inferred from the frequency of the searched keywords against the keywords of the new announcement.

The user has extensive search history with the following relevant keywords:
- Employment support: 13 times
- Design: 10 times
- AI: 10 times
- Web publishing: 10 times
- Education: 7 times

The user has shown significant interest in ""employment support"" with 13 searches, and a notable interest in ""design"" with 10 searches. Since both ""employment support"" and ""design"" are present in the new announcement's keywords, it strongly suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement (1).

In addition, the user's activity around employment-related keywords such as ""employment support"" and ""vocational training"" aligns well with the announcement's focus. Even though there are other keywords like ""AI,"" ""web publishing,"" and ""education"" that might not directly correlate with the new announcement, the high counts for the relevant keywords indicate a strong potential interest.

Overall, this pattern reflects a clear inclination towards the new announcement, signifying a positive interest level (1).",1

The user's search history shows they have searched for the keyword ""contest"" 17 times, while there are no corresponding records for ""planning.""

The new announcement includes the keywords ""Supporters,"" ""Supporters Recruitment,"" ""Press Corps,"" and ""Application Method.""

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps,"" and the new announcement directly includes these keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in this new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 1 indicates that they are interested in the new information.",1

Since there are no searches related to the keywords in the new announcement, it suggests that the user is likely not interested in this particular announcement, as their search behavior does not align with the topics provided.

Additionally, the user has also shown interest in the ""Bootcamp"" keyword, although the search history does not directly reflect this tag.

However, in the user's search history for announcements, they have searched for ""Graduate Students"" 21 times, ""Scholarship"" 17 times, and ""Undergraduate Students"" 12 times. 

This indicates that the user is primarily focused on topics related to graduate studies, scholarships, and undergraduate education rather than the new announcement's topics. Since there is no overlap between the user's past searches and the new announcement's keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely not interested in this particular announcement.",0
515,"Based on the given information, the user's keyword search history indicates a strong interest in job support with 13 searches, followed by design with 10 searches, AI with 10 searches, and web publishing with 10 searches. Although the user also searched for education 7 times, the new notice contains the keywords ""application method,"" ""education,"" and ""club.""

The presence of ""education"" in both the search history and the new notice suggests that this topic may capture the user's attention. However, since ""application method"" and ""club"" are new and not reflected in the user's search history, it's unclear whether the user has a specific interest in these areas.

Considering that the user has shown more interest in job-related topics and the keyword ""education,"" which aligns with their searches, the overall evidence suggests a lack of strong interest in the new notice, leading to a final score of 0.",0

Now, considering the new announcement keywords, which include ""exhibition,"" ""event,"" ""festival,"" and ""employment support,"" it is evident that there is a significant overlap between the user's search history and the new announcement. The user has actively searched for the first three keywords—exhibition, event, and festival—multiple times. This pattern indicates a clear interest in those topics.

Although ""employment support"" is not part of the user's recent search records, the strong attention given to the other related tags suggests that the user is likely to engage with the new announcement. Therefore, it seems that the user is indeed interested in this new notice. Thus, the ""target score"" would be 1.",1

The user has not searched for any related keywords to the new announcement; in fact, the relevant tags have no overlap with their search history. The user's most frequent searches (such as ""frontend"" and ""backend"") indicate a preference for technical training opportunities, but these do not align with the interests typically associated with contests or video content. Therefore, based on the lack of pertinent search activity related to the new announcement, it appears that the user is not interested in the new notice concerning ""contest,"" ""UCC,"" and ""video,"" aligning with the target score of 0.",0

Despite these frequent searches related to ""education"" and ""lecture,"" neither of these tags align with the new announcement's keywords. This suggests that the user is primarily interested in more general or possibly academic content, rather than specific information related to student engagement or job opportunities at the university level. Therefore, the mismatch between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords indicates that they are unlikely to have interest in this particular announcement, leading to the conclusion that their interest score is 0.",0

Since the new notice's keywords focus on student involvement and career guidance, which could potentially relate to knowledge needed for future employment, there is a slight overlap in themes.

However, none of the keywords in the user's search history directly match the new notice's keywords. The user demonstrates substantial interest in areas related to education and employment, but the specific focus on student participation and career exploration does not seem to resonate with the user's previous search interests. Consequently, the data leads to a conclusion that suggests a lack of interest in the new notice, correlating with the score of 0 for ""interest"".",0

The user's search history reveals that they have searched the tag ""education"" (translated from ""교육"") 24 times, indicating a significant amount of interest in this topic.

The new notice's keywords are specifically contest (공모전) and UCC (UCC). 

Given that the user has shown a strong interest in the contest keyword by searching it 18 times, this indicates a significant likelihood of their interest in the new notice, which has the same keyword. Additionally, the user has also searched for the UCC keyword 5 times, which further suggests that they may have some level of interest in this aspect as well.

This suggests that while the user has actively searched for announcements related to supporters and reporters, there are no relevant searches for the keywords connected to the new announcement.

The user's search history does include ""application method,"" which was searched 4 times, showing some level of interest. However, ""student support"" has not been recorded in the user's previous searches, indicating no interest in that topic.

Among these, the overlap with the user's search history is significant, particularly with ""강연"" and ""멘토링,"" which are also present in the user's previous searches.

Therefore, since the user has searched the relevant keywords multiple times and has shown a distinct pattern of interest in ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""education,"" we can conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Thus, the target score would be 1.",1

The user’s search history shows that they have searched for related topics primarily focusing on ""education"" (11 times), ""semiconductor"" (10 times), and ""blockchain"" (5 times). The fact that the user has searched for ""education"" 11 times indicates a significant interest in this area. However, there is no indication of interest in the keywords ""game"" or ""3D,"" as these were not present in the user's search history.

Given that the user has a strong interest in ""education"" and the new announcement includes this keyword, it's logical to deduce that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. This suggests that the model should predict a score of 1, indicating interest in the announcement.",0

The keywords from the new announcement are ""Supporters"" and ""Employment."" The user searched for ""Supporters"" 22 times, indicating a high level of interest.

With ""Education"" being one of the keywords in the new announcement and appearing in the user's search history 9 times, it suggests that the user has a notable interest in educational content. However, the presence of the ""Application Guide"" keyword does not correlate directly with the user's previous searches, making it less clear if the user would be interested in this aspect. Additionally, while they have shown considerable interest in diverse topics related to planning and contests, the lack of any relevant searches for applications leaves some ambiguity.

Given the fact that the user has engaged with the keyword ""Education"" and the overall interest in related themes, it can be inferred that the user may have some level of interest in the new announcement. However, due to the absence of interaction with the keyword related to ""Application Guide,"" the conclusion leans toward a lack of strong interest.

However, there are no searches related to ""Microcredential.""

Given that the user's search history contains no references to ""COVID-19,"" this indicates a lack of direct interest in the topic. While the user has been actively searching for related activities, they do not appear to show any engagement with the current announcement's keyword. Therefore, since there are no relevant search records aligning with the keyword ""COVID-19,"" it suggests that the user is not interested in this specific announcement.

There is no evidence of interest in the ""Application Method"" since this keyword does not appear in their search history. 

Given that the user has shown some interest in ""Supporters,"" but not in the ""Application Method,"" it suggests a somewhat limited engagement with the new announcement. Nonetheless, the absence of searches related to ""Application Method"" makes it challenging to deduce a strong interest in this particular announcement overall. Thus, the user's interest in the new announcement is considered low, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

While the user's strong interest in the general category of ""education"" indicates some potential alignment with the new announcement, it is not explicitly clear if the user is particularly interested in the specific aspects of ""student participation,"" ""Korea Aerospace University,"" or ""student recruitment"" mentioned in the new announcement. Nonetheless, the high search frequency of education-related topics suggests that the user may have a keen interest in announcements related to educational programs.

Since there are no relevant keywords in the new announcement to gauge the user's interest, it is difficult to determine whether the user would be interested (1) or not interested (0) in the new notice.

The new notice contains the keywords ""marketing"" and ""employment."" Considering that the user has searched for ""marketing"" 9 times, which is a significant amount, it indicates that they have a strong interest in this topic. Additionally, the keyword ""employment"" has been searched 8 times, suggesting that the user is also interested in job-related content. 

With this substantial engagement in the relevant keywords present in the new notice, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the announcement, thereby explaining the target score of 1 for their interest.",1

While the user has searched for ""competition"" 7 times, which relates to the new notice, their interest appears to be primarily in events rather than the specific themes of essays or literature. This limited alignment of search history with the new notice's keywords suggests that there is not enough interest from the user in this particular announcement.

Although the user did search for a variety of topics, none of the recent searches align with the keywords of the new notice. This indicates a lack of interest in the noticed topics.

561,"Based on the given information, the user's search history reveals a strong interest in various educational topics, as indicated by multiple searches for keywords such as ""취업 지원"" (employment support), ""교육"" (education), and ""무료 교육"" (free education). Notably, the user searched for ""교육"" (education) 4 times, which directly aligns with one of the new announcement keywords, suggesting a clear interest in this subject.

For the second keyword ""서포터즈"" (supporters), it appears that there is no direct reference in the search history, which indicates a lack of engagement with this specific area. Since the user has not searched for this term before, it is not possible to determine whether they have an interest in it or not.

Thus, given the consistent interest in ""교육"" (education) and the absence of related searches for ""서포터즈,"" we can deduce that while the user is likely to have interest in announcements related to education (aiming for a score of 1), their engagement with announcements related to supporters is unclear (which could lead to a score of 0). Therefore, the user's overall interest in the announcement can be summarized as positive due to the strong focus on education, while the absence of interest in supporters leaves ambiguity.",0

Given that there is no overlap between the user's search history and the tags associated with the new announcement, it seems that the user may not have a particular interest in this announcement. The absence of searches related to the new keywords suggests a lack of engagement with the content.

None of the user's search records specifically align with the topics of ""target audience"" and ""employment."" This suggests a lack of relevance between their interests and the new announcement.

The new announcement is focused on ""scholarship"", which directly aligns with the user’s interests.

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""scholarship"", it indicates a strong likelihood that they are interested in topics related to scholarships. Although the user also searched for the ""2024 academic year,"" the emphasis on the keyword ""scholarship"" in both the new announcement and the user's search history suggests their primary concern lies in scholarship-related announcements.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, which leads us to the target score of 1 (indicating interest).",1

Analyzing the search history, the user has frequently searched for ""education"" and ""lecture,"" which are also included in the new notice's keywords. This suggests that the user might be looking for opportunities related to education and lectures, making it likely that they have an interest in the new notice.

Given the substantial number of searches for the keyword ""education,"" it suggests that the user is quite interested in topics related to education. Although the new announcement includes ""event"" and ""contest,"" which were not specifically searched for by the user, the strong emphasis on ""education"" in their history indicates a likelihood of interest in announcements related to educational events or contests.

Thus, the target score of 1 suggests that the user is indeed interested in the new announcement, as their existing interest in ""education"" may translate to curiosity about initiatives or events that involve educational components.",1

Upon examining the user's recent search history which shows a few repeated searches like ""Academy"" (5 times), ""Education"" (4 times), and ""Cloud"" (3 times), we can see that the user has actively searched for topics related to education and cloud technology. However, while ""Cloud"" appears in both the new announcement and the search history, the absence of a strong correlation with other relevant tags (e.g., no searches for ""Big Data,"" ""AI,"" or ""Employment Linkage"") suggests limited overall interest in the new announcement, particularly given the varying contexts of the keywords.

Since the user shows no substantial engagement with the other keywords associated with the new announcement and since the main themes of the new announcement (such as Big Data and AI) do not closely align with the majority of their searches, this further substantiates the conclusion that the user likely does not have a keen interest in the new announcement's content.

While ""Mentoring"" overlaps with one of the new announcement's keywords, the user has only searched it 4 times compared to their higher frequency searches in other areas such as ""Server"" and ""Cloud.""

This indicates that although there is a slight connection through the ""Mentoring"" tag, the rest of their searches do not align with the new announcement's focus on ""Career Exploration.""

The newly announced keywords are ""application guidance"" and ""education"". Given that the user has searched for ""application guidance"" twice and ""education"" a significant 12 times, it suggests a notable level of interest in these topics. Specifically, the repeated search for ""education"" indicates a strong attraction to this subject area, making it reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

Given the user's search history, there seems to be no direct overlap with the new announcement's keywords.

Given that the user has searched for ""Supporters"" 9 times and ""Press Group"" 8 times, it indicates a strong interest in these tags. The absence of the keyword ""visual"" in the user's search history may leave some ambiguity regarding interest in that specific aspect. However, the frequent searches for ""Supporters"" and ""Press Group"" suggest that the user is likely interested in the new announcement due to their substantial engagement with closely related tags.

Among these, the tag ""application method"" aligns with the user's interests, as the user has demonstrated a considerable focus on this topic by searching for it multiple times. However, the other two keywords, ""contest"" and ""UCC,"" are not reflected in the user's search history, which suggests limited interest in those areas.

Given that the user has shown a strong interest in the ""application method,"" the presence of this keyword in the new announcement implies that the user is likely to be interested in the announcement. Therefore, it can be inferred that the user is 1 (interested) based on their previous search behavior, specifically regarding the tag ""application method.""",0
585,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes the keywords ""planning"" and ""contest."" The user's search history consists of the tags ""COVID-19"" searched 31 times and ""contest"" searched 19 times. 

Given that the user has a significant history of searching for the ""contest"" tag, it indicates a potential interest in the new announcement, particularly because one of the keywords matches their previous search behavior. 

However, the frequent searches related to ""COVID-19"" do not directly correlate with the new announcement's keywords, implying that the user's interest might lie more in the ""contest"" aspect. Since the user has actively engaged with the ""contest"" tag, this suggests they may find the new announcement relevant, thus supporting a score of 1 for the target score.",1
586,"Based on the given information, the user has shown interest in the keywords ""credit exchange"" and ""next-generation communication."" The user's search history reveals that they have searched for ""credit exchange"" 17 times and ""next-generation communication"" 12 times, indicating a strong interest in both subjects. The high frequency of searches for these keywords suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the user is interested in the new notification, resulting in a score of 1.",1

The new announcement's keywords include ""planning"" and ""contest."" 

In this case, the user has actively searched for the ""planning"" tag 10 times and the ""contest"" tag 6 times. Since both keywords from the new announcement appear in the user's search history, this suggests that the user has a noticeable interest in these topics. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, which aligns with the target score of 1.",1
588,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for tags related to ""서포터즈 모집"" 19 times, ""서포터즈"" 16 times, and ""기자단"" 15 times. The new notice includes keywords such as ""서포터즈,"" ""강연,"" ""기자단,"" ""콘텐츠 제작,"" ""멘토링,"" and ""교육."" 

Given that the user has a significant number of searches (19 times for ""서포터즈,"" 15 times for ""기자단""), it indicates a strong interest in these areas, particularly in ""서포터즈"" since it appears prominently in their search history. The presence of the keyword ""서포터즈"" in the new notice aligns well with the user’s interests, suggesting that they are likely to be interested in this announcement.

Although the user has also expressed some interest in ""기자단,"" which is similarly relevant, the keyword ""강연,"" ""콘텐츠 제작,"" ""멘토링,"" and ""교육"" have not been searched for recently by the user. However, due to the strong focus on ""서포터즈"" and ""기자단,"" it can be inferred that the user is indeed interested in the new notice.

Here, the ""목표평점"" of 1 indicates that the user is likely to have an interest in the new notice, largely supported by the frequency of relevant keyword searches.",1

However, the new announcement's keyword information indicates that there are no key keywords present. This lack of relevant keywords may imply that the user has no specific interest in this announcement, leading to a score of 0 for their interest level. The absence of important keywords suggests that the announcement might not align with the user's previously expressed interests.",0
590,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows interest primarily in topics related to ""cloud,"" ""server,"" ""security,"" and ""training schedule,"" with the search counts indicating a notable engagement with these areas. However, the new announcement's keywords include ""participation,"" ""international exchange,"" and ""student recruitment."" 

While ""participation"" has been searched once, the other two keywords, ""international exchange"" and ""student recruitment,"" have not been reflected in the user's previous searches. Thus, the minimal interest in ""participation"" and the lack of engagement with the other relevant topics suggest that the user is unlikely to have a strong interest in this announcement.

Given that the target score is 0, it appears the user does not find this new announcement appealing, which is consistent with their broader search history that focuses on different subjects. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user does not have an interest in this new notice.",0
591,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history includes tags such as ""event"" (7 times), ""meeting"" (8 times), ""club"" (8 times), and ""volunteering"" (6 times). However, the keywords for the new announcement are ""educational benefits,"" ""recruitment guidelines,"" ""others,"" ""application methods,"" ""IT education,"" and ""mentoring.""

The user's search history does not directly match the keywords of the new announcement, which suggests that there may not be a strong interest in this particular notice. Although the user has searched for related topics like ""event,"" which could potentially resonate with ""IT education"" or ""mentoring"" in a broader sense, the lack of specific overlap with the actual keywords makes it unclear if they will find the announcement relevant.

Since the user's ""goal rating"" is 0, it indicates they likely do not have an interest in the new announcement. The evidence supports this conclusion, as the keywords from the new notice don't align closely enough with the user's historical searches. Therefore, it seems that the user is not interested in this announcement.",0

The keyword information for the new announcement includes ""meeting"" and ""volunteering."" However, the user's search history shows a strong focus on ""scholarship"" (27 times) and ""2024 academic year"" (23 times). This significant volume of searches for unrelated topics suggests that the user is unlikely to have any interest in the keywords of the new announcement. Therefore, despite the potential relevance of meetings and volunteering, the absence of any searches related to these areas in the user's history supports the conclusion of disinterest.",0

Notably, the new announcement's keywords include ""행사"" (event) and ""이벤트"" (event), which is strongly aligned with the user's recorded interests. Given that the user has searched for ""행사"" and ""event"" frequently, it strongly suggests that the user is indeed interested in this new announcement, leading to a score of 1 for the likelihood of interest.",1
594,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a significant interest in job-related topics, as evidenced by their search history. The user searched for ""employment"" 17 times, ""education"" 14 times, ""employment support"" 8 times, ""bootcamp"" 6 times, and ""curriculum"" 5 times. 

The new announcement includes keywords such as ""employment,"" ""entrepreneurship,"" and ""internship."" Among these, the keyword ""employment"" directly aligns with the user’s highest interest, given that it is the most frequently searched term with 17 occurrences. The user's consistent engagement with jobs-related content suggests a strong likelihood that they would be interested in the new announcement. 

Although the keywords ""entrepreneurship"" and ""internship"" do not have corresponding searches in the user’s record, the dominant interest in ""employment"" indicates a potential willingness to explore related topics, making it reasonable to infer that the user is indeed interested in this new announcement.

595,"Based on the given information, the user has shown zero interest (0) regarding the new announcement which contains the keywords: National Subsidy, Employment Support, Vocational Training, and Game.

However, there is a significant disconnect between the user's interests and the new announcement's keywords. The user appears to be focused on job-related content, whereas the new announcement does not relate to that area, specifically lacking mentions of job recruitment or qualifications. Instead, it emphasizes broader themes like national support and vocational training without any indication of job-related specifics.

This divergence suggests that the user is likely not interested in the topics presented in the new announcement, affirming the score of 0 for their interest in this case.",0

The user's recent search history shows they searched for ""Supporters"" 19 times, ""Press Corps"" 8 times, and additionally searched for relevant tags such as ""Marketing,"" ""How to Apply,"" and ""Activity Benefits"" multiple times. Given that the user has shown substantial interest in ""Supporters"" by searching it 19 times, along with a significant amount of interest in ""Press Corps,"" which they searched 8 times, it indicates that they are quite likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the predicted score for this user’s interest in the announcement would be 1.",1
598,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords related to ""awards"" and ""planning."" However, the user's search history shows no interest in these particular keywords, as their recent searches include ""competition"" (18 times), ""UCC"" (11 times), ""essay"" (7 times), ""application period"" (6 times), ""credit exchange"" (4 times), and ""current students"" (4 times). Since there is no overlap between the new announcement's keywords and the user's search history, it suggests that the user likely does not have an interest in the new announcement.

However, the user's search history shows significant activity around different keywords, with the highest being ""AI"" (6 times), ""supporters"" (4 times), and ""contest"" (4 times). 

This discrepancy suggests that the user has focused their interests on areas related to AI, support roles, and competitions rather than job preparation or events. The user's lack of searches for any of the keywords associated with the new announcement indicates that they likely do not have a strong interest in these topics, supporting the conclusion that they would rate their interest level as 0.

The user has not searched for any of the relevant tags associated with the new announcement (competition, essay, literature). The absence of any related searches suggests that the user's interests are significantly different from the topics presented in the new announcement. As a result, it appears that the user is unlikely to find the new announcement appealing or relevant to their interests.",0
601,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keyword ""Supporters."" However, the user's search history shows that they have searched for the keyword ""Student Engagement"" 50 times.

603,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows a total of 50 records with various keywords related to their interests. Among these keywords, ""education"" appears as the tag for the new announcement. The user has searched for ""education"" 2 times, along with other related topics such as ""employment"" (5 times), ""cloud"" (4 times), and ""programming education"" (3 times). 

Given that the user has only searched for ""education"" a couple of times and has primarily focused on other tags, it suggests that their interest may not be strongly aligned with the new announcement. The absence of a significant number of searches related to the term ""education"" indicates a lack of emphasis on this specific area. Therefore, it seems that the user may not be particularly interested in this announcement, as evidenced by the low frequency of searches for the relevant keyword.

In conclusion, the overall search behavior points to a 0 rating for the user's interest in the announcement, aligning with the provided target score.",0

While ""AI"" appears in both the new announcement's keywords and the user's search history, the user has not actively searched for any of the other specific keywords related to the new announcement. Moreover, the user's primary interests seem to align more with events, contests, and various types of educational content rather than the specific free educational programs or backend/front-end training offered in the new announcement.

Given that the user has searched for ""Backend"" and ""National Funding Support"" multiple times, it indicates a potential interest in the new announcement. However, there is less activity regarding ""Frontend,"" which appears once in the search history.

Although ""Big Data"" and ""AI"" are not explicitly present in the user's search records, the strong interest in ""Bootcamp"" suggests a general engagement with educational opportunities, and the frequent search for ""Artificial Intelligence"" indicates an interest aligning with the new announcement's focus.

Therefore, the evidence presented in the user's search history strongly correlates with the new announcement's keywords, leading to the conclusion that they are likely interested in this new information.",1

The new announcement contains the following keywords: ""others"", ""education program"", ""job support"", ""design"", and ""video"". 

Since the user has searched for the keyword ""video"" the most, with 11 searches, along with a significant interest in ""job support"" and ""design"" (both searched 9 times), this indicates a strong likelihood that the user will be interested in the new announcement. With a clear interest in related topics, it would be reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement about these keywords.

The user has searched for ""Career Exploration"" 10 times, indicating a strong interest in this area. Additionally, they have searched for ""University Job Center"" 7 times, which also shows a notable level of engagement with this topic.

Since the user has a strong interest in ""education"" with 18 searches and there are relevant keywords in the new announcement, it suggests that the user is likely interested in this announcement.

Given the significant interest in ""education,"" it seems plausible that the user might be interested in the new notice. Though the lack of searches for the ""game"" and ""curriculum"" keywords leaves some ambiguity, the prominence of ""education"" in their search history suggests a higher likelihood of interest in the new notice.

Given the high frequency of the ""education"" keyword in the user's search records, it indicates a significant interest in this topic. The user has searched for related tags multiple times, especially ""education,"" which suggests that they are quite engaged with information linked to this keyword.

However, the new announcement has the keyword ""학생지원"" (student support), which does not explicitly match any of the user's previous searches. Therefore, while the user demonstrates a significant interest in educational and support-related content, the lack of overlap with the specific term “student support” indicates that they may not have a clear interest in this new announcement.

This suggests that the user's interests are primarily focused on student support-related matters and events, rather than topics related to bootcamps or online education. The new announcement's keywords do not align closely with the user's search history, which indicates a lack of connection and suggests that the user is likely not interested in the content of the new announcement.

In the user's recent 50 search records, ""Education"" appears only once. This limited engagement with the keyword suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in the subject matter related to the new announcement. Given that ""Education"" does not stand out in their search history alongside other more frequent topics, it leans towards the conclusion that the user is not particularly interested in this announcement.

Additionally, the lack of interest in ""visual"" makes the overall judgment less certain.

Since the user has shown significant interest in keywords relevant to ""competition"" (17 searches), it suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement, especially because one of the keywords matches their search history. However, the other two keywords, ""essay"" and ""literature,"" do not appear in the user's recent searches, which introduces some uncertainty regarding their interest in those areas.

Since ""competition"" is highly searched (17 times), this indicates a strong interest in that particular topic.

Specifically, the fact that the user has engaged with ""Contest"" a total of 13 times and ""Essay"" 11 times indicates a clear affinity toward them. 

Given these search frequencies, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is indeed interested in the new notice. Therefore, their goal score can be justified as 1, indicating that they likely have an interest in participating in the related events.",1
667,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for the keywords related to ""public contest"" (공모전) 17 times and has also searched for ""UCC"" 6 times, along with several other related keywords. The new notice has the keywords ""public contest"" and ""design."" Given that the user has a significant interest in ""public contest,"" as evidenced by the high frequency of searches, it is logical to infer that they are likely interested in the new notice. The user's search history suggests a strong inclination towards contests, which aligns with one of the key themes in the new announcement. Therefore, the likelihood of the user being interested in the new notice is high, leading to a target score of 1.",1
668,"Based on the given information, the user's search history shows that they have searched for the tag ""education"" 24 times, ""contest"" 15 times, and ""planning"" 11 times. The new notice contains the keywords ""education,"" ""participation,"" and ""lecture."" 

Given that ""education"" is a common keyword between the user's search history and the new notice, it indicates that the user likely has a significant interest in this topic. The high frequency of searches for ""education"" suggests that they are actively looking for related announcements or information.

On the other hand, the tags ""participation"" and ""lecture"" do not appear in the user's search history. This lack of previous searches for these specific tags makes it less clear whether the user has an interest in these areas.

However, due to the strong presence of the ""education"" tag in the user's search history, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice, especially since it aligns well with their previous searches. Thus, it can be inferred that the goal score of 1 (indicating interest) is appropriate in this context.",1
669,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""event"" and ""education."" The user's search history shows 24 times for ""education"" and 0 times for ""event."" Given that the user has searched for the keyword ""education"" 24 times, which indicates a strong interest in it, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice. The absence of searches for the keyword ""event"" does leave some uncertainty, but the significant search frequency for ""education"" suggests that the user may find the new notice relevant and is inclined to engage with it. Therefore, the target rating would be 1.",1
670,"Based on the given information, the user has a total of 50 search records for various notice tags. The most frequently searched tags include ""Contest"" (5 times), ""Student Support"" (4 times), ""Employment Support"" (4 times), ""Credit Exchange"" (4 times), ""Scholarship"" (4 times), ""Festival"" (4 times), and others. 

The new notice contains the tags ""Cybersecurity,"" ""Education Program,"" ""Employment Connection,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" ""Education,"" and ""Recruitment of Trainees."" 

Considering that the user has shown interest in educational topics, the tag ""Education"" is aligned with the user's past searches, being part of both the new notice and the user's search history. However, the other tags in the new notice do not appear to have direct matches in the user's previous searches, and there is no significant history of search for ""Cybersecurity,"" ""Employment Connection,"" ""Lecture,"" or ""Mentoring.""

In summary, the user does have an indication of interest toward the ""Education"" aspect, but due to the lack of significant searches related to the other tags in the new notice, it seems plausible to conclude that the user's overall interest in this particular notice may be weak. Therefore, the user's interest in the new notice is likely to be scored as 0 (no interest).",0

Additionally, there are multiple searches for related tags such as ""frontend development"" (4 times), ""frontend"" (4 times), and ""React"" (3 times), which are also present in the new announcement.

Given that the user has frequently searched for tags included in the new announcement, it suggests a clear interest in the topics covered. For example, the repeated searches for ""government support"" and ""backend"" indicate strong intent. Therefore, the user likely finds this announcement relevant and engaging, leading to the conclusion of a positive interest level. Hence, the target score is 1.",1

Given that the user has shown a significant interest in ""Education"" through frequent searches, it is reasonable to infer that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement, especially since the announcement is related to ""Education."" However, the absence of searches related to ""Youth"" leaves some uncertainty regarding that aspect. Overall, the strong focus on ""Education"" suggests a positive inclination toward the new announcement, supporting the target score of 1 for interest.",1

The user has shown interest in these topics by searching for them multiple times, but there is no overlap with the keyword ""application guide"" in the new notice. This absence may indicate that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new notice, as it doesn't align with their previous interests.

Overall, the user's search history aligns well with the new announcement's keywords, indicating that they likely have a strong interest in the topics presented in the new announcement. Therefore, the predicted score of 1 suggests that the user is interested in the new announcement.",1

The user's search history indicates that they have searched for ""Competition"" 17 times, ""Awards"" 4 times, and ""Participation"" 4 times. 

With a total of 25 searches related to the keywords in the new announcement, this strongly suggests that the user is indeed interested in the notice. The high frequency of searches for ""Competition"" particularly underscores their interest in that specific area, while the searches for ""Awards"" and ""Participation"" further reinforce the idea that the user is engaged with the content. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice, reflected by a target score of 1.",1
676,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Application Method"" and ""Contest."" The user's search record shows that they have searched for the keyword ""Student Support"" 18 times, ""Contest"" 17 times, and ""Planning"" 15 times. 

Since the user has shown a significant interest in the ""Contest"" keyword by searching it 17 times, it suggests that the user may be interested in the new announcement. However, their high interest in ""Student Support"" and ""Planning"" does not directly relate to the new keywords provided. Thus, while the presence of the ""Contest"" keyword indicates a potential interest and aligns with the user's previous searches, the overall context remains somewhat ambiguous regarding the user's interest in the new announcement.

Given these observations, the likely score would be 1, indicating that the user may be interested in the new announcement due to their search history related to the ""Contest"" keyword.",1

There are no matches between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords. The keywords ""Education,"" ""Inquiry,"" and ""Lecture"" do not correspond to any of the tags the user has shown interest in. This discrepancy suggests that the user is unlikely to find the new announcement appealing.

This suggests that the user's interests are predominantly focused on scholarships and upcoming academic events, which are unrelated to the themes of youth programs, lectures, mentoring, and education. Given the absence of any relevant searches corresponding to the new announcement's keywords, it appears that the user is unlikely to be interested in this offer, justifying the goal score of 0.",0

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the ""contest"" keyword by searching for it 18 times, it suggests a strong likelihood that they would be interested in the new announcement, as ""contest"" is one of its keywords. However, there is no search record indicating an interest in ""application method"" or ""poster,"" which may hint that while the user is interested in contests, their engagement with the other two keywords is uncertain.

Looking at the user's search history, the high frequency of searches for ""Supporters"" and ""Press Group"" suggests a strong interest in these topics.

The user's search history shows several keywords they have looked up: ""award"" (11 times), ""contest"" (10 times), ""planning"" (8 times), ""event"" (7 times), ""club"" (7 times), and ""meeting"" (7 times). 

Given that the user has searched for the keyword ""event"" 7 times, there is some indication of interest in this area.

While there is some interaction with the term ""event,"" the user has not explicitly shown a strong inclination towards events or festivals, as they have shown significantly more interest in ""award"" and ""contest.""

The presence of ""education"" in both the search history and the newly announced keywords suggests a strong correlation and indicates that the user is likely interested in the notice. Furthermore, the tag ""lecture"" is also present in both the search history and the new notice, which reinforces the notion of interest. As for ""mentoring"" and ""internship,"" while they do not appear in the search history, the user's significant interest in related tags implies a potential openness to other educational opportunities.

Given that the user has not searched for any keywords related to the new announcement, it seems unlikely that they have a strong interest in ""Company Exploration"" or ""Application Method.""

This low frequency indicates a limited interest in these specific subjects related to the new announcement. 

Although the user has searched for a variety of other educational and employment-related keywords multiple times, there is no strong correlation between the user's interests and the keywords of the new announcement.

However, the new notice's keyword is ""Contest."" 

Since the user does not have any recorded searches related to the ""Contest"" keyword, it's unclear if they are interested in this specific notice or not. The lack of relevant searches for the tag indicates that the user may not have a direct interest in contests, which likely leads to the conclusion that the user is unlikely to be interested in this notice. Therefore, I would interpret the target rating as 0 (not interested).",0
709,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a significant interest in the tags related to education, having searched for ""교육"" 18 times, which aligns with the new notice's keyword ""교육."" Moreover, the user has also searched for ""강연"" 11 times, which directly corresponds with the new notice's keyword ""강연."" These repeated searches indicate that the user is likely interested in topics related to education and lectures. 

The presence of the keywords ""콘텐츠 제작"" and ""멘토링"" in the new notice, however, did not have corresponding entries in the user's search history, making it uncertain if the user is interested in these specific areas. Nevertheless, considering the high frequency of related searches for ""교육"" and ""강연,"" it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is quite likely to be interested in the new notice, assigning a value of 1 for the target score.",1

The user has shown a significant interest in the ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps"" keywords, indicating their potential interest in the new announcement, which includes both of these keywords. Since the user searched ""Supporters"" 19 times and ""Press Corps"" 8 times, this suggests a strong likelihood that they would be interested in the new announcement. 

Therefore, based on their keyword search history aligning with the new announcement's keywords, it would be logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested, leading to a score of 1.",1

None of these search records directly align with the keyword ""supporters.""

Since the keyword ""supporters"" does not appear in the user's recent search history, it suggests that the user is unlikely to have an interest in this particular announcement. Therefore, the model would interpret the absence of relevant searches regarding ""supporters"" as an indication of disinterest, leading to a score of 0.",0

This can be inferred from their search history, which includes numerous technology and education-related keywords such as ""server,"" ""cloud,"" ""frontend,"" and ""job training,"" but does not include any terms related to ""student participation."" The absence of interest in this particular keyword, alongside the fact that all of the other tags show a clear focus on specific areas of professional and educational development, suggests that the user is unlikely to have a strong interest in the new announcement, justifying the target score of 0.",0
713,"Based on the given information, the new notice includes the keywords ""Youth"" and ""Online Education."" In the user's recent search history, there are no records related to these specific tags. Instead, the user has shown interest in various other topics, such as ""Job Preparation"" and ""Web Development,"" with the most frequent searches being for ""Other"" (6 times) and ""Job Preparation"" (4 times).

- ""Education"" was searched 11 times,
- ""Internship"" was searched 8 times, and 
- ""Employment"" was searched 7 times.

This suggests a strong inclination towards these topics, especially with such high frequencies in their search history. Therefore, it can be logically inferred that the user is quite interested in the new notice, leading us to categorize the ""goal score"" as 1 (indicating interest).",1

The new announcement has key tags including ""club,"" ""meeting,"" ""volunteer,"" and ""recruitment."" Given that the user has searched for ""club"" and ""volunteer"" multiple times—specifically, 12 and 6 times respectively—it suggests a genuine interest in these areas. Additionally, the tag ""meeting"" aligns with the user’s interest, as they have searched for it 3 times.

Overall, the presence of overlapping keywords between the user’s search history and the new announcement implies that the user is likely to show interest in the new announcement.

However, the new notice contains keywords ""Contest"" and ""UCC.""

This user’s search behavior indicates strong interest in keywords related to support and marketing, rather than any interest in contests or UCC. Since the new notice's keywords do not correlate with the user's previous searches and given that they show no past engagement with contest-related topics, it suggests that the user is likely not interested in the new notice.

However, the keyword ""Naming"" does not appear in the user's search history at all.

Considering the high frequency of searches for ""Competition,"" it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score of this user may be 1, indicating that they are indeed interested in the new announcement.",1

The user's search history indicates significant interest in the keyword ""course registration,"" as it has been searched 18 times, while ""image"" has been searched 13 times, ""important notes"" 10 times, and ""security"" 9 times. 

The substantial frequency of searches related to ""course registration"" suggests that the user is likely interested in announcements related to this keyword. However, since ""credit exchange"" has not been mentioned in the user's search history, it remains uncertain whether the user has any interest in that topic. 

Overall, since the user has repeatedly searched for ""course registration,"" it seems reasonable to conclude that they have a strong interest in the new announcement, particularly regarding the course registration aspect.

However, the new announcement does not contain any significant keywords that could attract the user's attention. 

Considering the lack of relevant keywords in the new announcement, it seems that the user's existing interests do not align with the announcement's content. Therefore, the evidence suggests that the user is likely uninterested in the new announcement, matching the goal score of 0.",0

Since there are no overlaps between the user's search history and the announcement's keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not particularly interested in this new announcement. The absence of relevant searches related to ""server,"" ""cloud,"" and ""security"" suggests that their interests lie elsewhere, reinforcing a lack of interest in the new announcement.

Despite the user showing a strong interest in ""COVID-19"" with 22 searches, the presence of ""Planning"" and ""Contest"" in their search history also indicates a reasonable level of interest in these topics as well. The user has searched for ""Planning"" 15 times and ""Contest"" 13 times, which reflects curiosity and potential interest in the new announcement. 

Overall, while the user may have a primary focus on ""COVID-19"", the significant number of searches for ""Planning"" and ""Contest"" suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion that the target rating is 1.",1

Although the new announcement contains only the keywords ""education"" and ""employment,"" the user's consistent engagement with these specific tags implies a likelihood of interest in the new announcement. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, which aligns with the goal score of 1.",1

Although the user has searched for ""competition"" 3 times, which indicates some level of interest, it does not strongly correlate with the new announcement's keywords, particularly since ""poster"" was not searched at all. The predominant focus of the user's searches relates more to educational and professional development opportunities rather than the specifics of the new announcement. Therefore, it seems the user is unlikely to be interested in this particular announcement.",0

The new announcement has keywords of ""Big Data,"" ""Others,"" ""AI,"" ""Vocational Training,"" and ""Employment Link.""

However, the other tags from the new announcement—namely ""Big Data,"" ""Others,"" and ""Vocational Training""—do not have any corresponding entries in the user's search history.

Given this information, while the user has shown a notable interest in ""AI,"" the lack of interest in the other key areas leads to the conclusion that the user might not fully engage with the announcement.

The user has searched for ""supporters"" 10 times and ""reporter group"" 11 times from their last 50 searches. Since both ""supporters"" and ""reporter group"" match the new announcement's keywords, it indicates that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

However, the new notice contains keywords related to ""competition"" and ""application period,"" which do not directly align with the user's previous search history.

Considering that the user searched multiple times for various educational and employment-related keywords, it suggests he is primarily interested in job opportunities and education. The absence of searches related to competitions or application periods indicates that the user is not likely to be interested in the new notice.

The user has shown a considerable interest in the tags ""education"" and ""lecture,"" having searched for ""education"" 12 times and ""lecture"" 5 times.

Since the new announcement lacks keywords, it is difficult to determine if the user would find it relevant or appealing.

While the user has searched for ""supporters"" less frequently, the presence of strong searches for ""education"" and ""lecture"" indicates an overall interest.

This indicates that the user has not expressed any direct interest in the new notice as none of the relevant tags appear in their search history.

However, the new notice only has the keyword ""Education.""

Given that there is no direct correlation between the user's search history and the keyword ""Education,"" it is difficult to ascertain whether the user has any interest in this specific notice.

The user's search history shows a significant number of searches related to various tags, including ""Planning"" (6 times), ""Tuition Support"" (5 times), and a few others that address education and employment, albeit with varying frequencies.

Given that the user has actively searched for educational-related tags multiple times, such as ""Tuition Support"" and ""Employment Preparation,"" it suggests a potential interest in topics related to support for students and career opportunities. However, the specific keywords of the new announcement, particularly ""Loan Support"" and ""Junior College,"" do not directly align with the user's recent search trends, which are broader and focus more on educational benefits and job preparation.

The absence of any direct overlaps with the keywords ""Loan Support,"" ""College Students,"" and ""Junior College"" in the user's recent searches makes it challenging to definitively conclude that the user has a strong interest in this new announcement.

This lack of intersection highlights a disinterest in the announcement, as the frequent searches in the user's history demonstrate a focus on different themes unrelated to ""AI"" and ""IT education.""

Analyzing the user's search history, we can see that they have searched for ""Planning"" (2 times) and ""Contest"" (4 times) among their records. However, the keyword ""Application Method"" was not searched at all.

While the user did explore ""Planning"" and ""Contest,"" the frequency of their searches indicates a moderate interest, but not strong engagement with these topics, particularly since they did not search for ""Application Method"" at all.

Both of these tags relate directly to the keywords of the new announcement, which are ""job"" and ""internship."" Although the user has not searched for these tags extensively compared to others in their search history, the presence of these keywords in their recent searches suggests a notable level of interest in the topics associated with the announcement.

The user has shown significant interest in the keywords ""contest"" and ""essay,"" indicated by their high number of searches for these terms. With 13 searches for ""contest"" and 11 for ""essay,"" it is evident that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement since two of the key topics they have actively searched for are directly related to it. Therefore, it can be inferred that the user's interest level is high, which aligns with the positive target score of 1.",1
794,"Based on the given information, the user's ""Announcement Search Record"" includes several tags with varying frequencies.

The new announcement contains keywords related to Planning and Contests. In the user's search history, there are 3 searches for the Planning tag and 2 searches for the Contest tag. Although these mentions are less frequent compared to the other tags they have searched for, the presence of both relevant tags in their recent searches indicates a potential interest in these topics.

However, since the overall search frequency for Planning and Contests is relatively low compared to other tags they actively searched for, it suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 0 is reasonable, as the evidence points to a lack of significant engagement with the relevant content.",0

Specifically, the user has searched for ""education"" 11 times, ""semiconductor"" 10 times, and other tags fewer times, with ""competition"" and ""AI"" being searched 3 times each.

The new announcement has a keyword of ""planning."" Since ""planning"" is not directly aligned with the user's previous interests, we can infer a bit of ambiguity in the user's potential interest in the new announcement. Although the user has shown considerable interest in ""education"" and ""semiconductor,"" which might tangentially relate to planning aspects within those domains, there is no direct correlation to the keyword ""planning.""

Thus, given that the user has not searched for ""planning"" and that the existing search records do not suggest any clear interest in this specific keyword, it's reasonable to conclude that the user is likely not interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

However, the new announcement keywords include ""Scholarship,"" ""High School Student,"" and ""College Student.""

Given that the user's search history includes ""Scholarship"" (mentioned 3 times) but does not show any searches specifically for ""High School Student"" or ""College Student,"" it suggests a lukewarm interest. The user might have some connection or interest in ""Scholarship,"" indicated by the searches, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest strong interest in the broader categories of ""High School Student"" or ""College Student,"" as these were not part of their recent searches.

Additionally, the user has also shown interest in ""mentoring"" by searching it 6 times. 

The presence of these related keywords in the user's search history suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

Since the user's search history does not include any keywords that overlap with the new announcement, it suggests a lack of interest in the provided information.

Notably, the search frequency for these tags is quite high, indicating a stronger preference for activities associated with them.

However, there is no mention of anything related to ""COVID-19"" in the user's search history. Since the new notice's keyword is specifically about ""COVID-19,"" and considering that the user has not searched for similar health or pandemic-related topics, it suggests that the user likely does not have an interest in this particular notice.

The highest interest appears to be in the keyword ""Education,"" which aligns with one of the new announcement's keywords.

However, the other keywords from the new announcement, such as ""Lecture,"" ""Content Creation,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Application Process,"" do not seem to have been actively searched by the user based on the provided search history.

Thus, while the user exhibits a significant interest in ""Education,"" the lack of engagement with the other relevant keywords makes the overall interest in the new announcement somewhat unclear. The user might be more likely to engage with the announcement due to their existing interest in ""Education,"" leading to a potential indication of interest (1), but the overall lack of searches related to the other keywords suggests a less certain level of interest.

Therefore, since the user has shown considerable engagement with these keywords and considering the relevance of the new announcement's tags to their search history, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1

The new announcement focuses on the keywords ""education"" and ""employment."" Given that the user has searched for the keyword ""education"" 8 times and ""employment"" 8 times, this suggests that the user is quite interested in these areas. The significant search frequency for both keywords aligns well with the new announcement's keywords, indicating that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice.

The new announcement has the keywords: ""Recruitment of Trainees"", ""Education"", and ""Employment."" 

The user has shown a significant interest in ""Education"" (13 times searched) and ""Employment"" (8 times searched), which directly align with the new announcement's keywords. Given this substantial overlap in interests, it is clear that the user is likely to have an interest in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score for this instance would be 1.",1

However, the user's search history shows a strong interest in different topics such as ""event"" (8 times), ""UCC"" (6 times), ""volunteering"" (6 times), ""event"" (5 times), and various others related to education and competition.

Since the user's search history does not contain any of the keywords from the new notice, it suggests little to no interest in the new announcement. The absence of relevant searches raises doubts about whether the user would be engaged with the notice, indicating a lack of interest. This aligns with the provided target score of 0, suggesting that the user is unlikely to be interested in the announcement.",0

However, the new announcement is related to the keyword ""bootcamp,"" which does not appear in the user's search history at all.

836,"Based on the given information, the new announcement's keyword information includes ""contest,"" ""essay,"" and ""literature.""

The other keywords, ""essay"" and ""literature,"" have not been mentioned in the user's search history, suggesting a lack of interest in those areas. Therefore, with a targeted interest evident from the user's search for contests, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in the new announcement regarding contests.

Given this analysis, the expected response is 1, indicating that the user is likely interested in the announcement.",1
837,"Based on the given information, the user's interest in the new announcement can be assessed through their recent keyword search history. The new announcement includes tags ""contest"" and ""application period,"" which do not directly correspond with the keywords the user has searched.

Given that the user has not expressed interest in keywords related to the announcement (i.e., contest or application period), it indicates a lack of relevance from their current interests. Therefore, it’s reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new announcement, leading us to deduce a target score of 0.",0

However, the keywords for the new announcement are ""AI"" and ""Backend.""

Since there is no overlap between the user's search history and the keywords from the new announcement, it suggests that the user may not have any interest in the new announcement.

The new announcement contains some relevant keywords such as ""강연"" (lecture) and ""멘토링"" (mentoring), alongside ""교육"" (education) and ""무료 교육"" (free education). Given that the user has searched these related tags multiple times, it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely interested in this announcement.

The user's search history does not align closely with the new tags. There is no direct reference to educational tags or mentoring, which makes it difficult to determine the user's interest in the new announcement. Given the absence of related search patterns, one could argue that the user is unlikely to show interest in the new announcement, thus supporting the target score of 0.",0

The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""Lecture"" 7 times, ""Mentoring"" 6 times, and ""Education"" 7 times.

Therefore, it seems likely that the user has an interest in this announcement, which corresponds to the target score of 1.",1
842,"Based on the given information, the new announcement has the keyword ""2024학년도,"" which does not align with any of the user's previous search history tags. The user's search history includes various tags such as ""education,"" ""big data,"" and ""employment,"" but none of these directly relate to the upcoming academic year 2024.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the keywords ""교육"" and ""강연"" through their search history, it is reasonable to conclude that they likely have an interest in the new announcement. Both keywords from the announcement are highly relevant to the user's past searches, which indicates a consistent pattern of interest.

Therefore, based on this information, the model should predict that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1

The user's search history indicates that they have shown significant interest in ""education"" with 11 searches, ""employment"" with 6 searches, and limited interest in other related tags. Given that they have frequently searched for ""education"" and have also searched for ""employment"" a reasonable number of times, it suggests a notable level of interest in these topics.

However, the user did not search for ""internship"" at all, which might leave some uncertainty regarding their interest in that specific area. Overall, since the user appears to have a strong focus on ""education"" and a decent level of search activity related to ""employment,"" it is likely that they are interested in this new announcement, aligning with the target score of 1.",1

The new notice's keyword information only includes ""Planning.""

Given this data, the user seems to have a strong interest in the keyword ""Planning,"" as indicated by their 9 searches for that specific tag. This suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement related to ""Planning."" Thus, the model's output for their interest in the new announcement should be 1, indicating that they are likely to have interest based on their search behavior.",0
846,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new announcement.

This indicates that the user has been predominantly focused on educational circumstances and financial support rather than creative works or literature.

The new announcement has the keywords ""essay"" and ""literature."" Given that the user has searched for ""essay"" 11 times and ""literature"" 10 times, it is evident that these two tags are among their more frequently searched topics. This consistent interest in related subjects strongly indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the user's engagement with these relevant keywords supports a positive score of 1 for the target rating.",1

The user's search history shows multiple tags with varying frequencies: ""contest"" has been searched 18 times, ""planning"" 8 times, ""poster"" 8 times, ""video"" 6 times, ""registration method"" 5 times, and ""UCC"" 5 times. 

Given that the user has demonstrated a significant interest in ""contest"" by searching it 18 times among their last 50 searches, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice about the contest. This strong correlation suggests a clear positive sentiment towards the information provided, which supports the target score of 1.",1

The user's announcement search history shows they have searched for ""contest"" 18 times, ""UCC"" 11 times, ""essay"" 7 times, ""submission period"" 6 times, ""credit exchange"" 4 times, and ""current student"" 4 times. The user has shown a significant interest in the ""contest"" keyword, having searched for it more frequently than any other keyword. Therefore, it is likely that the user is genuinely interested in the new announcement related to the ""contest"" keyword.

852,"Based on the given information, the user has a goal score of 0, indicating they are not interested in the new announcement. The keyword information for the new announcement contains no significant tags, which suggests a lack of strong appeal.

The user's search history indicates that they searched for the keyword ""education"" 9 times and ""lecture"" 6 times, suggesting a reasonable level of interest in both topics. However, the target score is 0, indicating that despite the search activity, the user does not find the announcement relevant or engaging at this time.

The user searched for the tag ""boot camp"" 5 times, ""frontend"" 5 times, ""backend"" 3 times, and ""design"" 3 times, which indicates a consistent pattern of interest in these areas. 

The new announcement's keywords include ""boot camp,"" ""frontend,"" ""application method,"" ""backend,"" ""design,"" ""online education,"" ""curriculum,"" ""frontend development,"" and ""video."" Given that the user has repeatedly searched for ""boot camp"" and ""frontend,"" this suggests they are likely interested in the announcement related to these keywords. 

However, the tags ""application method,"" ""online education,"" ""curriculum,"" ""frontend development,"" and ""video"" do not have corresponding search queries in the user’s recent history, making their relevance to the user more uncertain. 

Overall, considering the user's prior searches combined with the relevant new announcements, I would conclude that the user likely has an interest in the new announcement based on their strong engagement with the keywords ""boot camp"" and ""frontend.""

The user's search history shows 31 searches related to ""COVID-19"" and 19 searches related to ""contest."" Despite the user having a notable interest in ""contest"" with 19 searches, there are no searches for ""design."" 

Given that the user has actively searched for ""contest,"" it indicates a potential interest in the new notice. However, the absence of searches for ""design"" and the dominant focus on ""COVID-19"" suggests that the user's interests are currently skewed towards pandemic-related topics rather than design-related contests. This mix of evidence leads to a somewhat ambiguous conclusion regarding the user's overall interest in the new notice, though the significant number of searches for ""contest"" implies they may be somewhat interested, reflected in a target score of 1.",1

The user's search history shows a significant interest in related topics: ""Education"" was searched 23 times, ""Lecture"" was searched 18 times, and there were 9 searches related to ""Free Education."" 

Given the strong frequency of searches for ""Education"" and ""Lecture,"" it can be interpreted that the user is likely to have an interest in the new announcement since both keywords appear prominently in their search history.

Considering the new announcement's keyword information, which includes ""club,"" ""meeting,"" ""supporters,"" ""external activities,"" ""reporter's group,"" ""volunteering,"" ""online education,"" ""recruitment announcement,"" and ""recruitment guide,"" it can be observed that the user has searched for ""club"" and ""meeting,"" both of which are included in the announcement keywords.

The user searched for ""club"" and ""meeting"" a total of 11 times out of 50 search records, indicating a potential interest in those subjects. Nevertheless, while the frequency of searches aligns somewhat with the new announcement's keywords, the user has also searched for other unrelated tags, which renders their overall interest level in the announcement less certain.

Therefore, it is reasonable to interpret that the user's goal score is likely 1, suggesting that they may hold a certain level of interest in the new announcement, particularly due to their searches for ""club"" and ""meeting"" which are relevant to the announcement's content.",1

The user has shown a significant interest in the keywords related to the new announcement, particularly ""education"" (10 times), ""employment"" (7 times), ""lecture"" (5 times), and ""mentoring"" (4 times).

Given that the user has actively searched for keywords related to ""education"" 7 times, ""mentoring"" and ""lecture"" 5 times each, and ""content creation"" 4 times, it indicates a significant engagement with notices related to these topics. The presence of four keywords from the new notice in the search history suggests a reasonable level of interest from the user.

Given this context, the user has shown consistent engagement with topics related to their academic interests and employment rather than the social or volunteer-oriented themes presented in the new notice. The absence of any relevant searches for ""club,"" ""meeting,"" or ""volunteering"" suggests that these topics do not align with the user's current interests.

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""job"" and ""education,"" it is reasonable to infer that the user might be interested in the new notice as it contains both relevant keywords. The significant number of searches for ""job"" (17 times) indicates a strong inclination toward job-related information, while the 14 searches for ""education"" suggest an ongoing interest in educational opportunities.

Therefore, the alignment of frequent search history with the new notice keywords may suggest that the user is likely interested in the notice, which explains the target score of 1.",1

Given this analysis and the fact that the user has not shown search activity related to ""mentoring"" or ""educational program,"" there might be a slight uncertainty regarding those specific aspects.

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""교육"" and ""강연,"" which are also present in the new announcement's keywords, it strongly suggests that the user has a significant interest in the content associated with these tags.

The user's announcement search history reflects that they have searched the keyword scholarship 10 times, university student 7 times, and regional standards 3 times. 

The user has shown significant interest in the scholarship category, given the high frequency of their searches, particularly with 10 searches. Additionally, the presence of the university student keyword being searched 7 times indicates a strong alignment with the interest surrounding opportunities for students, enhancing the likelihood of engagement with the new announcement. The search for regional standards, while less frequent, still contributes to the relevance, as it matches with the added context of the new announcement.

Considering the user's interest as demonstrated by the frequency of searches corresponding to the keywords of the new announcement, it is reasonable to infer that the user is interested in this new announcement. Thus, the target score is 1 (indicating interest).",1

This ambiguity results in a score of 0 for the target rating, as the lack of alignment between the user's apparent interests and the new announcement's lack of keywords implies that the user is likely not interested in this announcement.",0

Additionally, the presence of the keywords ""education program"" and ""mentoring"" in the new announcement aligns well with the user's interests in education.

Furthermore, the keywords ""참가대상"" (participants), ""행사"" (event), and ""event"" were also searched frequently, suggesting the user is actively seeking information about events and their participants. The new announcement containing ""cybersecurity"" may be less relevant given that it does not directly relate to the user's higher search frequency keywords, but the educational aspect could still capture their attention.

While the user has searched ""Student Support"" 12 times which aligns with one of the new announcement's keywords, the absence of searches related to ""Scholarships"" indicates a lack of interest in that specific topic. Therefore, since the user has shown some interest in ""Student Support"" but not enough compelling evidence regarding ""Scholarships,"" it remains unclear whether they are overall interested in the new announcement.

Given that the user has shown a significant interest in the keyword ""competition"" by searching for it 18 times, it indicates that they are likely interested in announcements related to this topic. The other keywords ""planning"" and ""poster"" are not present in the user's search history, making their interest in those particular areas uncertain.

The user's search history indicates that they searched for the keyword 'employment' 7 times and 'internship' 2 times, which aligns with the keywords 'employment' and 'internship' from the new announcement. This suggests that the user may be interested in the announcement as it contains relevant terms that they have actively searched for.

However, the presence of keywords like 'trade,' 'government-supported programs,' 'lectures,' 'courses,' 'mentoring,' and 'entrepreneurship' in the announcement does not directly correlate with the user's previous searches, which mainly revolved around education and employment. This could imply that, while the user is somewhat interested in employment opportunities (as evident from their search frequency), their overall engagement with other topics in the announcement remains unclear.

Considering that the user has frequently searched for ""employment"" and ""education,"" these keywords align closely with the content of the new announcement.

While ""Contest"" overlaps with the user's search history, the user's overall interest in this category alone does not seem to be compelling enough for a positive engagement, given the lack of a more extensive interest in ""UCC"" or related terms. The limited focus on ""Contest"" and absence of a strong correlation to the user's consistent searches for ""Planning,"" ""Supporters,"" and other terms suggests that they may not find this announcement particularly engaging. Therefore, it appears that the user is not inclined to show interest in this new announcement, resulting in a score of 0.",0
912,"Based on the given information, the user has a significant interest in various technology-related topics based on their search history.

The new notice includes keywords such as ""free education,"" ""server,"" ""employment support,"" ""recruitment,"" ""programming,"" ""government-funded support,"" ""security,"" and ""IT education."" 

Since the user has searched for ""server,"" which is directly related to the new notice, it showcases their potential interest in this new announcement. Additionally, the keyword ""cloud"" is also present in the notice, further suggesting that the user may be inclined to engage with the content because of their previous searches. 

While the user has also shown some interest in other topics such as ""mentoring"" (4 times) and ""programming"" (3 times), these are less frequently searched compared to ""server"" and ""cloud."" However, the presence of ""programming"" in the new notice could resonate with the user's broader interests in technology.

However, the provided keyword information for the new announcement includes ""target audience"" and ""competition."" While the user demonstrated clear interest in the ""target audience"" tag, the absence of search history directly related to ""competition"" suggests that there is uncertainty about their attentiveness to that aspect.

Looking at the frequency of the searches, the user shows a strong interest in the ""contest"" keyword, having searched for it 17 times out of 50 total search records.

Since both of these tags are present in the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user is likely to be interested in this new announcement.

However, the keyword ""literature"" was not searched by the user, which may indicate that while they are engaged with the topics of contest and essay, they might not have expressed specific interest in literature as a standalone category.

The presence of the keywords ""club"" and ""meeting"" in both the new announcement and the user's search history suggests that the user may have a strong interest in these topics, especially considering that ""club"" and ""meeting"" have been searched a total of 11 times. The user also shows a high frequency of searching ""planning"" (15 times), which might indicate a general interest in organizing or participating in activities related to planning, events, and clubs.

Given the user's engagement with related keywords and the fact that the new announcement contains several keywords aligned with the user's past searches, it is reasonable to deduce that the user is likely interested in this new announcement, leading to a target rating of 1 (indicating interest).",1

The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""Competition"" 13 times, ""UCC"" 11 times, and ""Video"" 3 times. The user's substantial interest in the keywords ""Competition"" and ""UCC,"" as indicated by a high frequency of searches, strongly suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new notice. While their search for ""Video"" is comparatively lower, the overall data points towards a considerable interest in the notice, leading to a logical conclusion that the user has interest (1) in the new notice.",1
956,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""application method,"" ""education,"" and ""employment."" The user's search history shows a strong interest in the keyword ""education,"" as it appears 28 times, while ""lecture"" is searched 22 times. 

Given that ""education,"" which is one of the keywords in the new notice, has been frequently searched, it indicates that the user likely has a positive interest in this notice. However, the absence of searches related to ""application method"" and ""employment"" suggests their interest in those aspects might be limited. Therefore, while the user seems to be interested in the new notice due to their focus on the ""education"" keyword, the overall interest may not be as strong regarding the other keywords.

In conclusion, the user's substantial search history for ""education"" implies they are likely interested in the new notice, giving a favorable assessment with a score of 1.",1
957,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Planning"" and ""Contest."" However, upon reviewing the user's recent search history, we see that the user has searched related keywords predominantly focused on scholarships and students. Specifically, the keywords include ""Scholarship"" (10 times), ""College Student"" (7 times), ""General Public"" (5 times), ""Loan Support"" (5 times), and other educational categories.

Since none of the searched keywords relate to ""Planning"" or ""Contest,"" it suggests that the user has not shown an interest in these themes. Furthermore, the absence of any queries corresponding to the new announcement’s keywords indicates a possible lack of relevance to the user's interests. Therefore, the logical conclusion points toward the user likely being uninterested in the new announcement, aligning with the score of 0 for the target rating.",0

The new notice includes the keywords ""education,"" ""employment support,"" and ""AI.""

Given that the user has shown significant interest in ""education"" by searching it 8 times, which is notably the highest frequency among the searched keywords, it suggests a strong inclination toward this topic. Additionally, the user has searched ""employment support"" 6 times, indicating a practical interest in this area as well. The keyword ""AI"" has also been searched 5 times, further solidifying the user's interest in relevant topics related to the new notice.

Considering that the new notice's keywords align with the user's search history, and given the noticeable engagement with the topics of ""education"" and ""employment support,"" it can be logically concluded that the user is likely to be interested in this new notice. Therefore, the target score of 1 indicates that the user is indeed interested in the new notification.",1
959,"Based on the given information, the user's interest in the new announcement can be analyzed through the search history and the absence of significant keywords in the new announcement's tags. The new announcement does not contain any important keywords, which suggests a lack of focused topics that might engage the user. 

Looking at the search history, the user has explored various keywords such as ""Volunteer"" (9 times), ""Meeting"" (6 times), ""Club"" (6 times), ""Application Guide"" (5 times), and several others. The diverse range of keywords searched indicates that the user has multiple areas of interest. However, without a direct correlation to the new announcement's unspecified keywords, it appears that there may not be a strong relevance to the announcement.

Since the goal score is 0, it is reasonable to conclude that the user likely does not have a keen interest in this particular announcement, especially in light of the absence of specific keywords that resonate with their past searches. Given that the announcement lacks relevant content aligned with the user's previous search patterns, it reinforces the indication that the user would not be interested in this new information.",0

The search history indicates that the user has searched for the keyword ""youth"" 5 times out of their most recent 50 searches, showing a moderate level of interest in this specific area. However, the keyword ""education,"" although related, was not specifically searched for by the user. This creates ambiguity regarding the user's interest in the new notice.

Given that the user has shown some interest in one of the key topics (youth), while lacking any searches indicating interest in the other topic (education), it is reasonable to infer that the user may have a limited interest in the new notice. Therefore, based on this information, it seems the user is not strongly interested in the new notice, and I would conclude that the target score for this situation could be evaluated as 0 (not interested).",0

Given that the user has frequently searched for both ""Supporters"" and ""Press Group,"" it indicates a strong interest in these topics.

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""Supporters"" and ""Reporters Group,"" it indicates a strong interest in related topics. Although the keyword ""Employment"" and ""Entrepreneurship"" were not searched, the presence of ""Supporters"" and ""Reporters Group"" in both the user’s search history and the new announcement suggests that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement, reinforcing a positive likelihood of engagement.

Considering the user's search records, they have shown a significant interest in the keywords ""competition"" (10 times) and ""planning"" (8 times). This suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice since both of these keywords align with their search history.

The user's search history predominantly consists of the tag ""COVID-19,"" which they have searched 50 times. There is no mention of any keywords related to ""meeting"" in their search history.

Looking at the user's notice search history, we see that the user has searched for ""application method"" 5 times and has no searches directly related to ""recruitment announcement."" 

Although the user has shown some interest in ""application method"" by searching for it 5 times, the lack of searches related to ""recruitment announcement"" makes it unclear if they are genuinely interested in the new announcement as a whole. Overall, since the user has shown some degree of interest in one of the relevant keywords but has not searched for the other, we can infer that their level of interest might be limited.

The user's recent search history includes significant interest in ""Supporters"" (9 times) and ""Press Corps"" (8 times), indicating a clear inclination towards these topics.

However, the new notice has keywords that include ""2024 Academic Year"" and ""Winter Semester."" 

While the user has searched for the ""Winter Semester"" tag 11 times, which suggests a level of interest in this topic, the lack of searches related to ""2024 Academic Year"" raises questions about their specific interest in the new notification. The other tags from the user's search history do not align with the new notice's keywords either.

As the ""2024 Academic Year"" is a more specific and potentially distant topic, it may not resonate with the user, while the ""Winter Semester"" connects more closely due to the repeated searches.

Despite the frequency of searches for these related keywords, the absence of relevant keywords in the new announcement suggests that the user is unlikely to be interested.

Given that the user's searches are mostly focused on specific topics that do not align with the new announcement's content, this further reinforces the idea that the user is not interested in the new information presented.

The significant number of searches for Scholarship indicates a strong interest in this keyword, suggesting the user is likely to appreciate any related announcements.

However, examining the user's search history reveals that they have shown a strong interest in different keywords: they searched for ""Graduate Students"" 21 times, ""Scholarship"" 17 times, and ""Undergraduate Students"" 12 times. 

Given that the keyword in the new announcement does not match any of the tags that the user has frequently searched, it seems that the user is unlikely to be interested in this announcement. The absence of any relevant keywords in their search history, coupled with a clear focus on different topics, suggests a lack of connection to the new information presented.

Given that the new announcement contains keywords like ""Supporters,"" ""Supporters Recruitment,"" and ""Reporters,"" it suggests that the user may indeed be interested in the announcement. However, the absence of searches specifically related to ""Content Creation"" suggests a less direct interest in that aspect.

Given that the user has shown interest in the keyword ""supporters"" by searching it 22 times, it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely interested in the new notice since it has several relevant keywords related to their past search history. The repetition of the ""supporters"" keyword indicates a definite interest, and while ""meeting"" does not directly connect to the new notice, the strong frequency of the related keyword augments the likelihood that the user will be interested in this new announcement.

Therefore, considering the past search behavior and the presence of similar keywords in the new notice, the predicted interest level can be assessed as positive, leading to the goal score of 1.",1

Given that the user has searched for ""education"" the most times (9), followed by ""lecture"" (6) and ""mentoring"" (5), it appears that they have a significant interest in these topics. This strong frequency of searches related to the keywords of the new announcement suggests that the user is likely interested in the announcement, leading us to conclude a positive sentiment.

Although the new notice does not include the ""2024 Academic Year"" keyword, the repeated searches for ""Scholarship"" suggest a considerable level of interest in scholarship-related information. Given the interest in the relevant keyword ""Scholarship"" from the user's history, it seems likely that the user would be interested in the new announcement.

However, the new announcement contains keywords such as ""education,"" ""bootcamp,"" and ""AI."" 

The keyword ""education"" aligns with the user's search history, suggesting that the user may have a general interest in this area. However, there are no records reflecting direct interest in ""bootcamp"" or ""AI,"" making it unclear how engaged the user might be with those specific topics. 

Given the user's extensive searches related to education, it implies some level of interest in relevant announcements.

The new announcement has the keywords ""supporters"" and ""contest."" Since none of the user's search history aligns with these keywords and there is no indication of relevant interest towards ""supporters"" or ""contest,"" it suggests that the user is unlikely to find the new announcement appealing.

However, the new announcement contains no important keywords. This lack of relevant keywords means there may be no clear correlation between the user's previous searches and the new announcement. Therefore, it might be challenging to determine whether the user is interested in this new announcement or not.

The user's search history includes multiple instances of keywords related to job support, games, blockchain, education, and various job training programs, with specific searches like ""job support"" and ""IT education"" being prominent.

The search records indicate that the user has shown interest in job-related topics, with a total of 5 searches for ""job support"", 5 for ""game"", and 5 for ""blockchain"", among others. However, none of the keywords in the recent announcement are represented in the user's search history. This discrepancy suggests that the user may not have specific interest in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion that the user is unlikely to be interested in these topics based on their prior searches.

Since there is no overlap between the searched tags and the new announcement's keyword, it indicates that the user does not have a clear interest in the new announcement.

Given that the user has searched for ""contest"" 19 times, it suggests a definite interest in this topic. The absence of searches related to ""planning"" makes it challenging to ascertain interest in that aspect. Therefore, based on the higher focus on ""contest,"" it can be concluded that the user's interest aligns more with the announcement's ""contest"" aspect than with ""planning.""

Since the user has searched extensively for ""education,"" which is part of the new notice keywords, it indicates a strong likelihood of interest in the new announcement.

The new notice has the keywords: meeting, club, college student activities, lecture, mentoring, volunteering, and education.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the tag ""education"" (11 times), which is also present in the keywords of the new notice, it implies that the user is likely interested in the new notice as well.

Therefore, since the user has not searched for any tags related to ""scholarship,"" ""elementary school students,"" or ""middle school students,"" it is reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new notice.

However, the new announcement does not seem to have any significant keywords associated with it. This lack of relevant keywords makes it unclear whether the user would find this announcement interesting or not. Given that the user has shown considerable interest in both ""COVID-19"" and ""Contests,"" but the new announcement fails to relate to these topics, it aligns with the goal score of 0, suggesting that the user does not have an interest in this particular notification.",0

The user's search history reveals a strong focus on keywords related to clubs, employment, festivals, volunteering, gatherings, events, internships, and supporters, with the highest number of searches being for ""Clubs"" at 9 times and ""Employment"" at 9 times as well. 

However, none of the searched keywords correlate with the new announcement's keywords. The lack of searches for ""Education"" and ""Lecture"" in the recorded search history suggests that the user is likely not interested in this particular announcement.

The new notice includes keywords ""Participant"" and ""Contest."" The user has specifically searched for the ""Participant"" keyword 8 times and the ""Contest"" keyword 12 times. This indicates a clear interest in both keywords associated with the new notice. Given that these keywords align with the user's search history and show repeated engagement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice.

1084,"Based on the given information, the user has shown interest in three main categories of tags: ""education"" with 24 searches, ""contest"" with 15 searches, and ""planning"" with 11 searches. Given the new announcement keywords include ""lecture,"" ""free education,"" ""frontend development,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" and ""programming education,"" there is a strong correlation between the user's interests and the new announcement.

The user has a significant number of searches related to ""education,"" which overlaps directly with the ""free education"" and ""education"" keywords from the new announcement. This suggests a genuine interest in educational opportunities. Additionally, ""programming education"" could also draw the user's interest, given the popularity of programming in current educational trends. Although the tags ""lecture"" and ""mentoring"" have not been directly searched by the user, they are likely related to the user's interest in education.

Therefore, since the user has expressed a clear interest in education and related areas, we can logically conclude that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement. Thus, the probability of them being interested in this new announcement is high, leading us to assign a score of 1 for the ""target score.""",1

However, the keywords for the new announcement are ""application method"" and ""UCC,"" which do not appear in the user's recent searches.

The absence of relevant searches for the new announcement suggests that the user might not be particularly interested in it. While the user has shown considerable interest in bootcamp-related topics and employment support, these interests do not align with the topics presented in the new announcement. Given that there were no queries related to either ""application method"" or ""UCC,"" which are the key descriptors of the new notice, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user likely does not have interest in this announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

Since there are no search records that match the keyword ""security,"" it suggests that the user does not have a demonstrated interest in this topic based on their previous queries. The user's searches are more focused on job support and educational resources, making it unclear whether they would be interested in a notice related to security.

Therefore, considering the lack of relevant search history connected to the new keyword, it indicates that the user is likely not interested in the new notice, leading to a target score of 0.",0

However, the new announcement's keywords are ""server,"" ""cloud,"" and ""AI.""

The user's search history does not indicate any engagement with the keywords related to the new announcement. The absence of searches for ""server,"" ""cloud,"" and ""AI"" suggests that the user may not find this announcement relevant or interesting.

The absence of any searches related to ""Supporters,"" ""Event,"" or ""Press Corps"" suggests that the user's interests do not align with the tags presented in the new announcement. Thus, it seems logical to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in the current announcement, supporting the goal score of 0.",0

Given this data, it appears that the user's search history does not align with the keywords from the new announcement. The user has focused on design and planning rather than any topics related to portfolio creation, big data, or web development. Additionally, none of the keywords of the new announcement were present in the user’s search history, suggesting a lack of interest in these areas. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in the content of the new announcement, aligning with the target score of 0.",0

This suggests that there is a good chance the user might be interested in the new announcement since it contains keywords like ""Mentoring"" and ""Education,"" both of which align with their previous searches.

1093,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes keywords related to ""education"" and ""lecture.""

However, the new announcement features keywords ""scholarship"" and ""application eligibility,"" which do not match any of the user's recent search history.

Considering that the user has no recorded interest in the new announcement's keywords and their search behavior indicates a focus on other subjects, it seems unlikely that the user would be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 0 aligns with this reasoning.",0
1095,"Based on the given information, the new notice has keywords ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps."" The user's search history reveals that they have searched the keyword ""Supporters"" 22 times and the keyword ""Gathering"" 28 times. Since ""Press Corps"" is not present in the search history, it is clear that the user has shown significant interest in ""Supporters"" due to the frequency of searches. The keyword ""Gathering,"" while searched frequently, does not directly correspond to the new notice's keywords. Therefore, it can be interpreted that the user is likely interested in the new notice based on their past search behavior related to the keywords. The ""target score"" of 1 suggests that the user's interest aligns with the presence of the ""Supporters"" keyword in the new announcement.",1
1096,"Based on the given information, the user has not searched for any tags related to the new notice keywords of ""scholarship,"" ""college student,"" and ""regional criteria."" The user's search history shows significant interest in topics such as ""UCC,"" ""competition,"" ""inquiries,"" ""planning,"" ""career exploration,"" ""youth,"" ""supporters,"" ""reporters,"" and ""submission methods,"" with several searches for each.

The absence of searches related to the new notice's keywords suggests that the user is likely not interested in this particular notice, as there are no overlaps between their search history and the new key tags.

The user's search history shows a strong interest in these topics, as they have searched for ""education"" 11 times and ""lecture"" 7 times.

Despite these interests, none of the searched tags directly correspond to the keywords of the new announcement.

This lack of relevance between the user's search history and the keywords of the new notice suggests that the user does not have an interest in this particular notice.

Given that the keywords of the new announcement do not correlate with any of the user's previously searched topics, it seems unlikely that the user would find this new announcement relevant. Although there is substantial activity in areas related to education, none of the keywords in their search history match those in the new announcement.

The user has searched for both ""employment"" and ""internship"" a total of 12 times combined (6 times for each).

Nonetheless, the fact that they have engaged with the relevant keywords for ""employment"" and ""internship"" indicates that they might still be somewhat interested in the new announcement, albeit the overall search behavior suggests a more balanced curiosity rather than a focused interest.

Therefore, based on the evidence provided, it seems that the user is likely interested in the new announcement (1), but the consistent engagement in other topics might point to a broader range of interests that could draw their attention away.",0

While the user searched for elements related to jobs, such as ""Job Support,"" they did not search for any relevant terms linked to ""Backend"" or ""Frontend Development,"" which are crucial keywords for the new notice.

The new notice contains the keywords ""education,"" ""how to apply,"" and ""lecture."" Given that the user has searched for ""education"" 7 times and ""how to apply"" 5 times, it can be inferred that the user likely has a genuine interest in these topics.

While the user has shown some interest in ""festivals"" and ""events"", which aligns with the announcement, the overall interest in job-related tags is minimal, as there are no explicit mentions of ""job"", ""internship"", or ""startup"" in their search history.

Given that the user has not directly engaged with the most relevant keywords for the new announcement about ""job"" and ""internship"", it indicates a lack of interest. Thus, the target score of 0 suggests that the user is likely not interested in this announcement.",0

While the user has engaged with education-related keywords in their search history, the specific focus of the new notice on mentoring and inquiry might be too general or not as closely related to the user's predominant interests in backend programming and employment pathways. Since none of the keywords from the new notice strongly correlate with the user's extensive searches on backend and programming topics, it is difficult to definitively conclude that the user will find this new information appealing.

1121,"Based on the given information, the user’s ""목표평점"" is 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement. The keyword information for the new announcement includes ""Contest"" and ""Thesis."" 

In the user's search history, there are 8 instances related to ""Contest"" and no instances related to ""Thesis."" While the user has shown significant interest in the ""Contest"" keyword, the absence of any searches related to ""Thesis"" creates ambiguity regarding their overall interest in the announcement. The combination of a strong interest in one keyword and no interest in the other suggests that despite having some level of interest, the user may not find the complete announcement relevant to their needs or interests. Therefore, their overall engagement seems insufficient to warrant a positive interest rating, resulting in a score of 0.",0
1122,"Based on the given information, the user's search history reveals a significant focus on various tags, with notable repetitions such as ""공모전"" (8 times), and other keywords like ""3D"", ""디자인"", ""UCC"", ""청년 프로그램"", among several others, all searched 4 times each. However, the new announcement does not contain any significant keywords that could draw the user's interest. 

Since the new announcement lacks important keywords, it is difficult to gauge the user's interest based solely on the absence of relevant tags. Although the user's previous searches exhibit a pattern of interest in specific themes, the lack of matching keywords in this particular announcement suggests that the user may not be interested (0). The disparity between the user's extensive search activity and the absence of keywords in the announcement leads to the conclusion that engagement with this new notice is unlikely.",0
1123,"Based on the given information, the user has shown interest in the following tags: ""Planning"" (14 times), ""Contest"" (12 times), ""Scholarship"" (9 times), ""Participants"" (8 times), and ""Inquiries"" (7 times). The new announcement's keywords are ""Planning,"" ""Contest,"" and ""Essay.""

Since the user has searched for ""Planning"" significantly (14 times) and ""Contest"" (12 times), it suggests a strong interest in these topics. However, there is no record of the user searching for ""Essay,"" which may indicate a lack of interest in this particular keyword. The repeated searches for ""Planning"" and ""Contest"" point toward the user's likelihood of being interested in the new announcement containing those related keywords.

Given that the user has positively engaged with keywords that match the new announcement, I would conclude that they are likely interested in the new announcement, as indicated by the score of 1.",1
1124,"Based on the given information, the user's search history shows significant interest in the tags ""서포터즈 모집"" (19 times), ""서포터즈"" (16 times), and ""기자단"" (15 times). However, the new announcement keywords include ""Free Education,"" ""Training Program,"" ""Employment Support,"" ""Design,"" ""3D,"" and ""Video."" There is no overlap between the user's previous searches and the new announcement keywords.

Given that the user has shown considerable interest in different tags related to ""서포터즈"" and ""기자단,"" but none of the new keywords relate to those interests, it suggests that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 0 indicates that the user probably does not find the new information relevant or appealing to their interests.",0
1125,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a certain level of interest in the tags related to ""education"" and ""competition,"" having searched for ""education"" 24 times, ""competition"" 15 times, and ""planning"" 11 times. However, the new announcement only includes the keywords ""education"" and ""employment."" 

The user has a high frequency of searching for ""education,"" which indicates a strong interest in that area. Therefore, it is likely that the user would be interested in the new announcement due to the presence of the ""education"" keyword. On the other hand, there is no mention of ""competition"" or ""planning"" in the new announcement's keywords. 

Given this context, it can be reasoned that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, particularly because of their previous search behavior related to ""education."" Thus, the score of interest or ""목표평점"" is 1.",1
1126,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates that they searched for the keyword ""COVID-19"" 31 times and ""contest"" 19 times. The new announcement's keywords include ""event,"" ""education,"" and ""contest."" 

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the ""contest"" keyword with 19 searches, it suggests they may have some level of interest in the new announcement, especially since ""contest"" is one of the keywords listed. However, the user has not searched for ""event"" or ""education"" at all, leaving those keywords unaccounted for in their search behavior.

Therefore, while the high number of searches for ""contest"" indicates a potential interest in the new announcement, the lack of searches related to the other keywords keeps the user's overall interest somewhat ambiguous. In conclusion, it appears that the user may have some interest in the announcement (1), particularly related to the contest aspect, but the absence of searches for the other keywords leads to uncertainty regarding their overall interest in the announcement as a whole.",1
1127,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for various keywords related to academic exchange, planning, backend, education, lectures, eligibility, competitions, events, and the 2024 academic year. The keyword record indicates significant interest in topics such as academic exchange, which was searched 6 times, and other related subjects like education and events. However, the new announcement's keywords are ""meeting"" and ""volunteer,"" which do not directly match any of the keywords the user has frequently searched.

Since the user has not shown any previous interest in ""meeting"" or ""volunteer,"" it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely not interested in this new announcement. This leads to the determination that the target rating is 0, indicating no interest in the new announcement.",0
1128,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Supporters,"" ""Press Corps,"" and ""Inquiry."" The user's notification search history includes the keywords ""Supporters"" 8 times, ""Press Corps"" 8 times, ""Contest"" 8 times, ""Eligibility"" 7 times, ""Student Participation"" 6 times, and ""Planning"" 5 times. 

Looking at the user's search history, there is a significant interest in the ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps"" keywords, both of which match the new announcement. With 8 searches each for ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps,"" it suggests that the user has a strong inclination towards those topics. While the keyword ""Contest"" is frequently searched as well, it does not directly relate to the new announcement. 

Overall, since the user is actively searching for related topics that align closely with the new announcement’s keywords, it indicates a high likelihood of interest in the announcement. Therefore, the user's interest in the new announcement can be logically inferred as 1 (interest).",1

The new notice's keywords are ""supporters"" and ""employment."" The user has only searched for the tag ""supporters"" once among their records. The fact that this tag appeared only once indicates that the user's interest in ""supporters"" is minimal, and likewise, they have not searched for ""employment"" in any capacity. 

Given that there is very little overlap between the search history and the new notice's keywords, it appears that the user is not particularly interested in this new notice. Therefore, the model's output should align with the goal score of 0, indicating no interest in the announcement.",0
1130,"Based on the given information, the user’s interest in the new announcement can be assessed. The new announcement includes keywords: lecture, free education, mentoring, and education. However, the user’s recent search history includes tags such as ""credit exchange"" (17 times), ""next-generation communication"" (12 times), ""winter session"" (11 times), ""student recruitment"" (6 times), and ""application guidance"" (4 times). 

The user has not shown any interest in the keywords related to the new announcement, as none of the searched tags correspond to ""lecture,"" ""free education,"" ""mentoring,"" or ""education."" Given the lack of overlap between the searched keywords and the new announcement's keywords, it indicates that the user likely does not have an interest in this specific announcement, leading to a goal score of 0.",0
1131,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a clear interest in various educational programs and support related to employment as evidenced by their search history. They have searched for keywords such as ""Education"" (6 times), ""Education Program"" (5 times), ""Job Preparation"" (3 times), and ""AI"" (3 times). 

The new announcement contains keywords such as ""Education,"" ""AI,"" and ""Employment Support,"" which are directly aligned with the user's interests. The user has searched for ""Education"" and ""AI,"" indicating a potential interest in these topics. However, despite the lack of specific searches for ""Big Data,"" ""Backend,"" ""Frontend,"" and ""Non-Major Education,"" the presence of ""Education"" and ""AI"" suggests that the user might still find relevance in the announcement.

Given this context, the target score of 0 indicates that the user is not interested in the new announcement. It could be inferred that while there are relevant keywords, they may not be compelling enough for the user, possibly due to the absence of significant engagement with the other related keywords in their search history. Thus, the decision points to a lack of strong interest in the newly presented notice.",0
1132,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keyword ""Supporters."" The user's recent search history reveals that they have searched ""Supporters"" 3 times, alongside other keywords such as ""Job Preparation"" (4 times), ""Web Development"" (3 times), and ""Front-end Development"" (3 times). Although the interest in ""Supporters"" is not predominant compared to other categories, the fact that it has been searched 3 times indicates a moderate level of interest in this specific keyword. 

Considering that the overall engagement with related tags is relatively low, it's understandable that the model would assign a score of 0, indicating that the user might not have a strong interest in this particular notice. The repeated searches of ""Supporters"" suggest some interest, but it may not be enough to determine a clear preference, making the outcome somewhat ambiguous.",0
1133,"Based on the given information, the user has searched keywords related to various topics, including ""other"" (기타), ""job preparation"" (취업 준비), ""web development"" (웹 개발), and ""club"" (동아리). The user has specifically searched for ""club"" 1 time, and there are no mentions of ""education"" (교육) in the user's recent search history.

This raises some ambiguity regarding the user's interest in the new announcement's keywords. While the user has shown some interest in ""club,"" it is not significant enough to draw a strong conclusion about their overall interest in the announcement since the search count is low. Additionally, the absence of searches related to ""education"" indicates a lack of interest in that specific area. Therefore, given the overall context, it seems that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new announcement, aligning with the target score of 0.",0

Specifically, the user has searched for ""교육"" (education) 10 times, ""취업"" (employment) 7 times, ""강연"" (lecture) 5 times, and ""멘토링"" (mentoring) 4 times. The new announcement includes related keywords such as ""교육"" (education), ""취업 지원"" (employment support), ""강연"" (lecture), and ""멘토링"" (mentoring).

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""교육,"" which directly corresponds to one of the key terms in the new announcement, it suggests a strong interest in educational content. Additionally, the searches for ""취업"" and ""강연"" also align with the new announcement keywords, reinforcing the idea that the user is likely to be interested in the new information.

Therefore, considering the user's active engagement with related topics and the keywords present in the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user has a positive interest in the announcement, leading to a ""목표평점"" of 1.",1

The user has shown the most interest in the tag ""event,"" which correlates directly with the new announcement as ""event"" is one of the keywords listed. This suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement due to their repeated searches for ""event."" Given this consistent interest, it can be inferred that the user probably has a positive sentiment toward the new announcement, leading to a target score of 1.",1

Notably, two tags from the announcement—""Supporters"" and ""Reporter Group""—are present in the user's search history, indicating a clear interest in these areas. The user has shown a strong inclination towards similar activities, as evidenced by their high search frequency of related tags.

Given the strong presence of ""Supporters"" (which directly correlates with the user's previous searches) and ""Reporter Group,"" and considering the general interest in participation and external activities, it can be concluded that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, supporting the target score of 1.",1

The new announcement's keywords include ""employment consulting,"" ""job preparation,"" ""education,"" ""lectures,"" ""mentoring program,"" and ""mentoring."" 

Given that the user has searched for ""employment"" (6 times), ""education"" (7 times), and ""mentoring program"" (3 times), there is a clear interest in themes related to employment and education, which are reflected in the new announcement's keywords.

The new announcement contains the keywords ""supporters"" and ""press corps."" Given that the user has searched for the tag ""supporters"" 8 times and ""press corps"" 8 times as well, it indicates a strong interest in these topics.

Given that the user has shown a significant interest in ""Cloud"" and ""Security"" with 12 and 8 searches, respectively, it suggests that they may have a strong interest in topics related to these keywords. Additionally, the user also has 5 searches for ""Server,"" which is also included in the announcement’s keywords. However, the user has no searches for ""Big Data,"" ""Cybersecurity,"" ""Government Support,"" ""AI,"" or ""Cloud Infrastructure,"" which indicates these might not align with their interests.

The new announcement contains keywords such as educational program, academy, application guide, lecture, mentoring, and education.

Since the user has shown a significant interest in education-related topics, with the highest search frequency being for education at 11 times and related keywords such as lectures appearing 5 times, it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

The absence of searches related to ""K-Digital"" raises further doubts about the user's relevance to the new announcement. Overall, while there is a slight indication of interest due to the searches related to ""AI,"" it is insufficient to determine strong interest in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion that the user likely does not have a significant interest in this content, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

The user has searched for ""server"" (5 times), ""AI"" (4 times), ""big data"" (3 times), ""security"" (5 times), and ""cloud"" (5 times), which align closely with the keywords in the new notice. 

Given this solid overlap in interests, as indicated by the frequency of search terms that match the new notice keywords, it suggests that the user is quite interested in the new notice.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the ""Supporters"" related tags, but none of their search history matches with the keywords of the new announcement, it suggests that the user may not be interested in the new announcement. The discrepancy between their search interests and the new announcement's keywords leads to the conclusion that this user likely does not have a strong connection to the newly presented information.

The user's search history shows a high interest in ""education,"" with it being searched 23 times, and ""lecture,"" which might be related to the ""education"" keyword, being searched 18 times as well. However, ""club"" has not been searched at all. 

The strong presence of searches for ""education"" suggests that the user is likely interested in this notice, especially since they have actively sought out related information multiple times. The absence of searches for ""club"" leaves some ambiguity regarding that specific aspect of the notice. Still, overall, the user's searches indicate a degree of interest in educational topics.

Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in this new notice, supporting the target rating of 1.",1

The user's recent search history includes the keyword ""Contact Information"" 3 times and ""Backend"" 3 times, among other keywords. While there is a presence of both keywords in the search history, they appear relatively infrequently compared to the user's other interests, such as ""Marketing"" and ""Employment"", which have a higher frequency of searches. Consequently, this suggests a moderate level of interest in the new notice. However, because the search frequency for both relevant keywords is lower than that of other topics, it's likely that the user is not particularly focused on these specific keywords, leading to a score of 0 for the interest in the new notice.",0

There are no overlaps between the keywords in the user's search history and those of the new announcement. This lack of relevant keyword searches suggests that the user does not have interest in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion of the score being 0. The absence of related searches indicates that the user's interests are focused on different topics, which do not align with the keywords for this announcement.",0

The new notice contains keywords such as ""동아리"" (club), ""모임"" (meeting), ""청년 프로그램"" (youth program), ""강연"" (lecture), ""멘토링"" (mentoring), ""봉사"" (volunteering), ""교육"" (education), and ""진로 탐색"" (career exploration).

Given that ""교육"" and ""강연"" are among the tags in both the user's search history and the new notice, it suggests that the user is likely interested in this announcement. While the presence of ""청년 프로그램"" and ""멘토링"" also relates closely to the educational aspect, the user's searches for keywords linked more directly to these new topics point towards a genuine interest. 

Overall, since the user actively searched for related topics such as education and lectures, it strongly supports the hypothesis that they are interested in the new notice. Thus, the expected outcome, or target score, is 1, indicating an interest in the new announcement.",1

Looking at the user's search history, we see 'Contest' has been searched 4 times and 'Design' has not been explicitly mentioned in the search records. Although 'Contest' is relevant to the new notice, the lack of searches for 'Design' makes it unclear whether the user has a specific interest in that aspect of the notice.

Given that the user has searched for 'Contest' multiple times, it indicates a certain level of interest in related topics. However, since 'Design' is completely absent from the user's search history, it suggests that the user's interest in the new notice is ambiguous. 

Therefore, while there is a slight indication of interest due to the search frequency for 'Contest', the lack of engagement with 'Design' leaves room for doubt. Consequently, the overall assessment of the user's interest in the new notice might lean towards a score of 0.",0

Given that the user has shown significant interest in ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps,"" which are also present in the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user likely has a strong interest in the new announcement.

Although the user has searched for ""Education,"" the frequency is relatively low compared to their interest in other activities such as ""Supporters"" and ""Press Group.""

Given that the user has frequently searched for related terms such as ""supporter recruitment"" and ""supporters,"" it strongly indicates their interest in topics related to supporters.

The user's search history indicates a strong interest in ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring,"" which are also keywords in the new announcement. The repeated searches for ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring"" suggest that the user is likely interested in these areas.

Additionally, the user has also searched ""application period"" 6 times, indicating some level of interest in this aspect as well.

Since both keywords in the new notice align well with the user's previous search history, it suggests a strong likelihood that the user is interested in this new announcement. Thus, the target score of 1 indicates that the user is likely to be interested in this new notice.",1

The frequent searches for ""education"" and ""lecture"" indicate a strong interest in these subjects. However, the absence of searches for ""mentoring"" makes it unclear whether the user is interested in that particular topic.

Given that the user has a total of 31 searches related to keywords present in the new announcement, and considering the target score is 1, it suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

Since none of the searched tags in the user's history overlap with the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user might not be interested in this new announcement. The absence of relevant searches indicates that the topics of ""job support,"" ""design,"" and ""video"" do not align with the user's previous interests as reflected in their search history.

Notably, the user has searched for ""AI"" and ""Education"" multiple times, indicating a potential interest in the new announcement that includes these keywords. Although the tag ""Backend"" was not present in the user's search history, the interest in ""AI"" and ""Education"" suggests that the user might find the content of the announcement relevant.

The user has a significant interest in contests, as evidenced by the high frequency of searches for that particular keyword. The search for ""paper"" is not explicitly mentioned in the search history, which may indicate a lack of interest in that specific topic.

Given that the user has searched Planning 9 times and Contest 8 times, it suggests a notable level of interest in these topics. Although the user has not searched for the AI keyword specifically, their significant activity around the other two keywords indicates a likelihood that they may also be intrigued by related content.

Specifically, the user has searched for ""Supporters Recruitment"" 19 times, ""Supporters"" 16 times, and ""Journalist Group"" 15 times. Since the new announcement's keyword is ""Supporters,"" it aligns closely with the user's recent search activity. Given that the user has repeatedly searched for related terms multiple times, it indicates a strong likelihood that the user is indeed interested in the new announcement regarding ""Supporters.""

This indicates a strong interest in ""lecture"" and ""mentoring,"" while ""education"" is also relevant, though less frequently searched.

Overall, the user has demonstrated significant engagement with the keywords in the new notice, especially in ""lecture"" and ""mentoring."" Given that the user has interacted with related topics multiple times, it is reasonable to conclude that they likely have an interest in this new notice.

None of these keywords align with the new announcement's keywords. 

This lack of overlapping interest indicates that the user is likely not interested in the new announcement, supporting the target score of 0.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the ""competition"" keyword by searching for it 17 times, it suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new notice since it directly includes that keyword. However, there are no searches related to ""paper,"" making it unclear whether the user has interest in that particular topic.

The user has shown a strong interest in both keywords present in the new announcement, as evidenced by the high frequency of their searches. Specifically, the user searched for ""literature"" 13 times and ""essay"" 11 times, indicating a clear interest in these topics.

Considering the goal score of 1 indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, it can be concluded that the user is indeed interested in the announcement based on their previous search behavior.

The absence of searches related to ""Planning"" and ""Design"" suggests that the user might not have a strong interest in this new announcement. Since none of the relevant keywords from the announcement appear in their recent search history, this implies that they are unlikely to be interested in it. Therefore, the logical conclusion would be that the user does not have interest in the new announcement, which corresponds to a target score of 0.",0

Although there is a significant interest in ""planning,"" the user has clearly shown an interest in ""contest"" as well, having searched for it 17 times. This suggests that the user might likely be interested in the new announcement, especially since one of its key topics is ""contest,"" which aligns with their search history.

Given the provided ""target score"" of 1 indicates that the user is interested in the announcement, we can conclude that the presence of ""contest"" in both the new announcement's keywords and the user's search history reinforces their potential interest. Therefore, the model would likely predict a score of 1 for the user's interest in the new announcement.",1

Additionally, the user has also expressed interest in ""College Student"" and some degree of interest in ""Regional Standards,"" albeit less so. 

Considering the high frequency of searches for ""Scholarship,"" it strongly suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

The new announcement tags, ""student recruitment"" and ""content creation,"" do not overlap with any of the user's previous searches.

The absence of any searches related to the keywords in the new announcement suggests that the user does not have an interest in the content provided.

The user's search history shows a strong interest in ""COVID-19"" and ""contest,"" but there is no indication of interest in events. Therefore, since the keyword ""event"" does not align with the user's demonstrated interests in ""COVID-19"" and ""contest,"" it suggests that the user is unlikely to be interested in the current announcement.

This indicates a consistent engagement with ""모임"" and ""봉사,"" suggesting a potential interest in the new announcement that includes these keywords.

However, ""모집"" does not appear in the user's search history, which may indicate that they do not actively seek out opportunities for recruitment.

The user's search history includes the following tags and their respective search frequencies: ""Call"" (8 times), ""Supporters"" (8 times), ""Press Corps"" (8 times), ""Contest"" (8 times), ""Eligibility"" (7 times), ""Student Participation"" (6 times), and ""Planning"" (5 times).

Although the user has searched for ""Contest"" 8 times, which aligns perfectly with the new announcement's keyword, it is noteworthy that they have also shown equal interest in multiple related tags such as ""Call,"" ""Supporters,"" and ""Press Corps."" This indicates a broader interest in participatory events, suggesting they may value announcements related to contests.

However, with a target score of 0 indicating no interest in the new announcement, it raises some ambiguity. It might imply that while they have searched for the ""Contest"" tag, they do not find the specific announcement relevant or compelling enough to consider. It could also suggest that they are not actively pursuing that particular contest or that their interest does not translate to engagement with this new information specifically.

Therefore, despite the user's considerable search frequency for related keywords, the lack of interest expressed by the target score of 0 suggests that the specific new announcement may not fully resonate with them.",0
1244,"Based on the given information, the user has a record of searching for the following keywords: ""education"" (18 times), ""lecture"" (11 times), ""reporter group"" (11 times), and ""supporters"" (10 times). The newly announced notice contains the keyword ""curriculum,"" which is related to ""education."" 

Although the specific keyword ""curriculum"" does not appear in the user's search history, the term ""education"" was searched 18 times. This suggests that the user has a strong interest in education-related topics. However, since there is a lack of direct matches between the keyword in the new announcement and the user's recent searches, it is not entirely clear whether the user would be interested in this particular notice.

Based on this analysis, the likelihood of the user being interested in the new notice could be considered moderate. Despite the absence of the exact keyword, the frequent searches related to ""education"" point toward a potential interest in related topics. Therefore, the user's interest in the new announcement can be seen as uncertain, possibly leading to a score of 0.",0
1245,"Based on the given information, the new announcement has a keyword related to ""scholarship."" However, the user's search history shows no interest in this specific topic, as the most frequently searched tags are related to marketing, planning, meetings, press groups, benefits of activities, employment, contests, events, and supporter recruitment. The user has not searched for any tags that correlate with ""scholarship,"" which indicates a lack of interest in this area. Therefore, it appears that the user likely does not have any interest in the new announcement regarding scholarships, reflected in the target score of 0.",0
1246,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Submission Method"" and ""Contest."" The user's search history shows a strong interest in relevant topics, specifically searching for ""Planning"" 33 times and ""Contest"" 17 times. Given that the user has searched for the ""Contest"" keyword, which directly aligns with the new announcement, it suggests that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement. 

The high frequency of searches for ""Planning"" could also indicate the user's broader interest in related topics. Overall, it appears that the user has a strong interest in the new announcement, supporting the target rating of 1.",1
1247,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords such as education, employment, and internship. The user's search history shows that they have searched the following tags: ""employment support"" 5 times, ""server"" 4 times, ""curriculum"" 3 times, ""video"" 3 times, ""free education"" 3 times, ""government-funded support"" 2 times, and various other tags. 

Looking at the user's search behavior, it is notable that they have shown a significant interest in topics related to employment, as indicated by their frequent searches for tags related to ""employment support"" and ""government-funded support."" However, while the keyword ""education"" appears in the new announcement, it hasn't been specifically searched as frequently as ""employment support."" As for the keyword ""internship,"" it does not appear in the user's search history at all. 

Thus, while the user has demonstrated some interest in topics related to employment, their overall engagement with education and internships is limited. Therefore, with the combination of keywords and search patterns, it seems plausible that the user may have some interest in the new announcement but not enough to strongly indicate they are fully invested in all aspects, leading to a score of 0 for the target rating.",0
1248,"Based on the given information, the user's interest assessment seems to lean towards the negative. The user's search history indicates a focus on the following tags: ""planning"" (14 times), ""contest"" (12 times), ""scholarship"" (9 times), ""eligibility"" (8 times), and ""inquiries"" (7 times). 

In contrast, the new notice contains keywords such as ""job announcement,"" ""qualifications,"" and ""application method,"" which do not align with any of the user's frequently searched tags. This significant discrepancy suggests that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new notice, as they have not shown any prior engagement with related topics. Therefore, the goal score of 0 is justified, indicating that the user is not interested in the new notice.",0
1249,"Based on the given information, the user's search history includes the following tags: ""Education"" (12 times), ""Lecture"" (7 times), ""Press Corps"" (5 times), ""Thesis"" (5 times), ""Employment"" (4 times), ""Student Participation"" (4 times), ""Supporters"" (3 times), ""Curriculum"" (3 times), ""Recruitment"" (3 times), ""2024 Academic Year"" (2 times), and ""Application Guide"" (2 times). 

The new notice has the keywords ""Scholarship,"" ""Elementary Students,"" and ""Middle School Students."" Given that there are no direct matches between the new notice keywords and the user's search history, it indicates that the user may not have a specific interest in the scholarship announcement aimed at elementary and middle school students.

Considering the user's past searches, while the overall trend indicates engagement with educational content, the specific keywords in the new notice do not align with the user's previous searches. Thus, it seems unlikely that the user would have a strong interest in this announcement, which justifies the score of 0 for the target assessment.",0
1250,"Based on the given information, the user has shown no interest in the new notice since the goal rating is 0. The keyword information for the new notice lacks significant keywords, indicating that it may not capture the user's attention. 

Furthermore, analyzing the user's search history reveals that they have searched for various tags multiple times, with the most frequent being ""government support"" (8 times), ""backend"" (6 times), ""programming"" (5 times), ""bootcamp"" (5 times), ""frontend"" (5 times), ""employment support"" (5 times), ""government-supported education"" (4 times), ""thesis"" (4 times), ""full-stack development"" (4 times), and ""educational program"" (4 times). 

Given the absence of relevant keywords in the new notice, combined with the existing interest reflected in the user's search history, it suggests that the user is unlikely to find the new notice engaging or relevant to their interests.

Therefore, the predicted score is 1, suggesting that the user has an interest in the notice.",1
1252,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new announcement. The new announcement contains the keyword ""Planning."" However, analyzing the user's search history reveals that they have searched for ""Planning"" only 5 times out of 50 total searches, which suggests a relatively low level of interest in this particular keyword compared to other topics.

The user's historical searches show a strong inclination towards ""Contest"" with 13 searches, ""Essay"" with 11 searches, and ""Game"" with 10 searches. This pattern indicates a preference for other topics, thus making it less likely for the user to be interested in an announcement that only contains the ""Planning"" keyword.

Overall, while there is some interaction with the ""Planning"" keyword, it is minimal compared to the user's stronger interests in other areas, leading to the conclusion that the user is likely not interested in this announcement.",0
1253,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history includes tags such as ""Supporters"" searched 12 times, ""Credit Exchange"" searched 10 times, ""Student Support"" searched 10 times, ""Application Guide"" searched 8 times, ""Eligibility"" searched 6 times, and ""Course Registration"" searched 4 times. However, the new announcement does not contain any significant keywords. 

Given that there are no relevant keywords in the new announcement, it may be challenging to determine whether the user is interested (1) or not interested (0) in this particular announcement. This lack of significant keywords leads to ambiguity regarding the user’s interest level, suggesting that they may not find the new information appealing based on their prior search history.

The user's search history reveals that they have searched for ""Education"" (18 times), ""Lecture"" (11 times), ""Media Group"" (11 times), and ""Supporters"" (10 times). The repeated searches for ""Education"" indicate a strong interest in this area. Thus, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice regarding education.

The user's search history shows a significant interest in the keyword ""Supporters,"" which they searched 26 times. However, there is no mention of the keyword ""Application Method"" in their search history.

The user's focus on the ""Supporters"" tag indicates that they are likely interested in this area, as they have sought out information related to it quite frequently. The lack of searches for the ""Application Method"" keyword suggests that they may not be as interested in that aspect of the announcement. Given these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the announcement due to the strong representation of related searches in their history.

Therefore, the target score of 1, indicating an interest in the announcement, aligns with the user's search behavior concerning the keywords provided.",1
1256,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement.

The user's search history indicates that they have searched for ""scholarship"" 2 times, while they have not searched for ""university student"" or ""regional criteria"" at all. 

Given that the user has only a limited interest in scholarships based on their search history, it suggests they may not be fully engaged with the new announcement since their attention primarily lies in other areas. The absence of searches related to ""university student"" and ""regional criteria"" further indicates a lack of relevance to the user's interests. Therefore, it seems that the user is unlikely to show strong interest in this new announcement, which explains the target score of 0.",0

Since the user frequently searched for ""Education,"" it suggests they have a strong interest in that area. Although the new notice also includes ""Target Audience,"" the lack of related searches makes it uncertain if the user is interested in that specific aspect. However, the significant interest in ""Education"" indicates that the user is likely interested in the new notice.

While the user has expressed some interest in ""Design"" with 9 searches, the lack of searches for ""Ministry of Employment and Labor"" suggests a limited interest in the new notice overall.

Additionally, the ""event"" keyword has also been searched several times, suggesting a keen interest in related activities.

However, there is no record of the user searching for ""poster,"" which creates some uncertainty. Nonetheless, given the strong frequency of related keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice and thus can be rated with a target score of 1.",1
1263,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history indicates they have shown a significant interest in the keywords ""Student Support"" (18 times searched), ""Competition"" (17 times searched), and ""Planning"" (15 times searched).

In particular, the user searched for the ""lecture"" (강연) tag 5 times and the ""education"" (교육) tag 12 times. The user has a strong interest in education-related topics, as evidenced by the highest frequency of the ""education"" tag. Given that the new announcement's keywords include both ""education"" and ""lecture,"" it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement, as their search history aligns closely with the key topics of the new notice.

Although they also searched for ""2024 Academic Year"", it does not directly relate to the new announcement's keywords.

Given the high frequency of searches for ""Scholarship"", it can be deduced that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the user has an interest in the information provided in the announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1

1286,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new notice. The keyword information for the new notice is ""student engagement."" However, the user's recent search history reflects a strong focus on specific educational and employment-related tags, such as ""education"" (9 times), ""event"" (5 times), and ""employment support"" (3 times). Despite the frequency of searches for tags pertinent to education and events, none of these directly aligns with the concept of ""student engagement.""

The lack of any searches related to ""student engagement"" suggests that the user does not have a strong interest in this particular theme. Even though the user has been actively searching for related educational content, it appears that their interests are more inclined towards structured educational programs and employment opportunities rather than participation or engagement aspects. Therefore, based on this discrepancy between the search history and the notice's keyword, it can be concluded that the user likely has no interest in the new notice regarding ""student engagement,"" leading to the assigned goal score of 0.",0

However, the new announcement does not appear to have any significant keywords associated with it.

The user's past searches show a significant interest in Employment and Education, as they have searched for these tags multiple times. Specifically, the user searched for the tag 'Employment' 12 times and 'Education' 5 times. These strong search frequencies suggest that the user is likely interested in the new notice, especially since it includes both keywords they have engaged with previously.

Given this information, it can be concluded that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice, which corresponds to the target score of 1.",1

The new announcement has keywords related to 'event' and 'event'. While the user has searched for 'event' 6 times, which indicates some level of interest, the dominant focus on 'design' and 'planning' suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in the current event-related announcement. The discrepancy between the user's predominant search interests and the new announcement's keywords results in an overall assessment that the user is likely not interested in the new announcement, thus reinforcing the score of 0.",0

Although ""Lecture"" is not directly related to the new notice, the high frequency of searches for ""Education"" suggests that the user is likely interested in topics related to education. 

Since the new notice includes ""Education,"" and the user has searched for it multiple times, it indicates that there is a significant alignment between the user's interests and the new notice. The absence of both ""Competition"" and ""AI"" in the search history makes it a bit less certain if the user specifically cares about these keywords, but the strong interest in ""Education"" leads to the conclusion that the user is likely to be interested in this notice, reflecting a positive score of 1.",1

The user has shown interest in various topics such as scholarships, eligibility, employment, free education, and events, but none of these keywords align with ""student support.""

Since there is no overlap between the new announcement’s keywords and the user’s search records, it appears that the user has not expressed any interest in the topics related to the new announcement. The absence of searches related to ""Government Support,"" ""Employment Support,"" ""Job Training,"" and ""Games"" suggests that the user is unlikely to be engaged with this announcement, leading to the conclusion that their interest level is low.",0

Considering that the new announcement contains two relevant keywords that the user has previously searched for, it suggests that the user is likely interested in this new announcement.

While the user's search history includes ""education,"" which is also a keyword in the new announcement, they have primarily shown interest in topics related to employment and qualifications rather than the specifics of lectures, content creation, mentorship, and application processes. This suggests a lack of direct relevance or interest in the newly announced information, as their excessive search on job-related topics does not correlate strongly with the new keywords provided.

Given that none of the tags from the user's search history align with the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user has not shown any interest in these particular topics. The absence of common keywords leads to the conclusion that the user likely does not find the new announcement relevant, which supports the target score of 0.",0

Looking at the user's recent search history, we see that they have searched for ""Employment Support"" 1 time, ""Training Incentives"" 3 times, ""AI"" 3 times, and other relevant tags such as ""IT Education,"" ""Free Education,"" and ""Job Connection."" However, ""Education"" as a specific keyword does not appear prominently in their history. 

In summary, while the user shows a certain level of interest in tags related to employment and education, the limited number of searches for ""Employment Support"" and the lack of direct searches for the keyword ""Education"" suggests that their interest in the new announcement is not strongly supported. Therefore, the predicted score would likely be 0, indicating that the user may not have a strong interest in the new announcement based on the provided data.",0
1299,"Based on the given information, the user's search history shows significant interest in various topics related to mentoring and education, with tags such as ""mentoring"" (7 times), ""target participants"" (7 times), and ""lecture"" (7 times) being searched frequently.

The new announcement includes keywords such as ""employment consulting,"" ""job preparation,"" ""education,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring program,"" and ""mentoring."" The presence of the tags ""education,"" ""lecture,"" and ""mentoring"" in both the user's search history and the new announcement suggests a strong likelihood of interest. 

Although the user searched for ""mentoring"" and relevant educational content, they also have shown a notable interest in applying this knowledge, indicated by their searches for ""application method."" However, there is no direct mention of ""employment consulting"" or ""job preparation"" in their previous searches, which might indicate less relevance. 

Still, the correlation between the user's prevalent interest in mentoring and the related keywords in the announcement point towards a potentially high interest in the announcement.

The user has shown significant interest in ""education"" (9 searches), which aligns with the announcement's keyword of ""education program."" Additionally, the user has searched for ""employment"" 3 times, relating closely to the ""employment support"" keyword in the announcement.

While the user’s interest in ""education"" and ""employment"" suggests that they may be somewhat interested in the new announcement, the absence of searches related to the other keywords makes it difficult to ascertain a strong interest across all topics.

Therefore, considering the strong interest in relevant tags and the mixed relevance of others, it is somewhat reasonable to conclude the user has some interest in the new announcement (1). However, it is not definitive given the mixed signals from the search history.",0

The new notice includes the keywords ""Competition"" (공모전) and ""Thesis"" (논문). Given the user's significant search history for ""Competition,"" it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in this new notice, especially since the keyword is directly aligned with their past searches. 

However, ""Thesis"" has not been searched by the user at all, making it unclear if the user has any interest in this topic.

However, the absence of related keywords in the new announcement suggests that none of these topics are sufficiently aligned with the new notice.

Given that the user has shown considerable interest in specific tags related to education and scholarships, yet found no relevant keywords in the new announcement, it seems unlikely that they would be interested in this particular notice.

In conclusion, while the user shows a strong inclination towards educational topics, the lack of relevant searches for all the keywords in the new notice complicates the determination of their interest in the notice as a whole.

Specifically, the user has searched for ""lecture"" 10 times, which suggests a strong interest in that topic. Additionally, the keyword ""education"" has also been searched 6 times, indicating a moderate level of interest. 

Considering the pattern in the user's search history and the relevant keywords in the new announcement, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score for their interest in the new notice would be 1.",1
1325,"Based on the given information, the user has shown interest in various topics related to support programs, youth, employment, education, and events, as indicated by their search history. However, the new announcement's keywords are ""employment"" and ""internship,"" which relate specifically to job-seeking and internship opportunities.

Despite the user's significant engagement with employment-related matters (5 times for ""취업""), there is no mention of internships in their search history, indicating a possible lack of interest in that specific area. Since the user has not searched for the ""internship"" keyword at all, this raises doubts about their interest in the new announcement.

Overall, it can be inferred that while the user has some interest in employment-related topics, their search history does not show enough correlation with the specific keywords of the new announcement, leading to a conclusion of a lack of interest (0) in this particular notice.",0

However, the new announcement keywords provided are ""poster"" and ""competition.""

The user has not shown any interest in the specific keywords related to the new announcement, as none of the searched tags align with ""poster"" or ""competition."" The absence of relevant searches indicates a lack of interest in the announcement. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is not interested in the new announcement, as evidenced by the ""goal score"" of 0.",0

Given this data, it suggests that the user has a significant interest in the keywords related to the new announcement, particularly ""Planning"" and ""Contest,"" since they have searched for these tags multiple times. The frequency of searches indicates that the user is likely to be engaged with information related to these topics. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the user has an interest in the new announcement, which aligns with the target score of 1.",1

The new announcement's keywords are ""planning,"" ""contest,"" and ""submission period."" 

Given that the user has searched for the ""contest"" tag multiple times, it indicates a strong interest in contests. Additionally, the ""planning"" tag, which is one of the new announcement's keywords, has also been searched 5 times, albeit less frequently. This suggests that the user might have some interest in planning-related topics as well. 

Considering the user’s engagement with both ""contest"" and ""planning,"" it seems likely that the user would be interested in the new announcement, especially since it relates to keywords they have previously shown interest in. Therefore, the target score of 1 is appropriate, as the user appears to have a positive inclination towards the content of the new announcement.",1

The user has particularly searched for ""big data"" and ""server"" multiple times, which align strongly with the new announcement's keywords, suggesting a clear interest in these topics. Additionally, the user's search for ""employment"" might indicate a broader interest in career-related opportunities, which is relevant to the keyword ""employment link."" 

Given the frequency of searches for related terms, it can be concluded that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 1 is justified.",1

However, the new announcement's keyword is ""web publisher.""

Considering that ""web publisher"" does not directly correlate with any of the user's previous searches, it suggests that there might not be a strong interest in this particular announcement. The absence of relevant searches relating to ""web publisher"" points towards a lack of engagement or curiosity for this new information. Therefore, it seems more logical to conclude that the user is not particularly interested in the announcement, as evidenced by the provided data.

In this case, the ""목표평점"" is 0.",0
1331,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a considerable interest in various tags, particularly in job support, servers, education programs, and design, with multiple searches recorded.

The low frequency of searches for 'design' and the absence of 'competition' in the user's history suggest a limited interest in this new announcement. Even though there is some relevance due to the 'design' keyword, the overall engagement with the keyword data for this specific announcement is not strong enough.

Thus, it seems that the user is likely not interested in this announcement, which corresponds to the provided target score of 0.",0

Since there is no overlap between the user's search history and the new notice's keywords, it seems that the user has not searched for anything related to ""Student Participation"" or ""Event.""

1337,"Based on the given information, the user's interest in the new announcement can be inferred from their search history and the lack of relevant keywords in the announcement. The new announcement does not contain any significant keywords, which suggests that it may not capture the user's attention effectively.

Looking at the user's search history, we observe that they have searched for various tags related to employment (8 times), education (6 times), exhibitions (4 times), and other associated topics like internships, startup, youth programs, and mentoring. However, since the new announcement has no specific keywords, it is difficult to determine any direct relevance to the user's interests based on their search records.

Given that the user has frequently searched for the tags ""education"" and ""lecture,"" which overlap with the new notice's keywords, it suggests a strong interest in these topics. The fact that the user searched for ""free education"" reinforces this interest further, as it directly matches one of the new notice's key tags.

Considering the combination of the user’s interest in ""lecture"" and ""mentorship,"" along with the presence of these keywords in the new announcement, it suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

This disparity between the user's search history and the new notice's keywords suggests that the user is focused on areas such as design and planning, rather than the topics related to programming and backend development.

Given that none of the previously searched keywords directly align with the new announcement keywords, it suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.

The new announcement contains the keywords 'planning,' 'contest,' and 'design.' Notably, the user has shown a strong interest in 'contest' by searching for it 17 times. This suggests a significant level of interest in contests, which aligns with one of the keywords in the new announcement. However, there are no direct searches related to 'planning' or 'design' noted in the user's previous history, making it unclear how much interest the user might have in those areas.

Considering that the user has actively searched for a keyword directly linked to the announcement, it seems likely that the user is interested in this new announcement about contests. Therefore, the model would likely predict an interest level of 1 (indicating interest).",1

Given that the user has searched for ""Education"" the most (12 times) and also engaged with significant keywords like ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring,"" it indicates that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

Given the high frequency of searches for ""education"" and ""employment,"" it indicates that the user is likely interested in these topics. The absence of searches related to ""bootcamp"" leaves some ambiguity about their interest in that specific area.

Also, ""lecture"" is explicitly mentioned in both the user's past searches and the new announcement, indicating the user likely has a strong interest in this content.

Considering these factors, it's reasonable to conclude that since the user has actively searched for related topics, they may be very likely interested in this new announcement. Thus, the user's interest can be logically interpreted as positive, leading to a target score of 1.",1
1410,"Based on the given information, the new announcement has a keyword ""COVID-19."" However, the user's recent search history shows that they have searched for ""Supporters"" 26 times and ""Press Corps"" 24 times. Since none of the user's searches are related to the keyword ""COVID-19,"" this suggests that the user is likely not interested in this specific announcement. Therefore, the target score of 0 indicates a lack of interest in the announcement.",0
1411,"Based on the given information, the new announcement does not contain any significant keywords, which makes it difficult to determine whether the user is interested or not.

Given the absence of relevant keywords in the new announcement, it is unclear if there is any direct connection or interest from the user.

The new announcement contains the keywords: ""Education,"" ""Exhibition,"" ""Festival,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Event."" 

Notably, the user has shown a significant interest in the tags ""Education,"" ""Lecture,"" and ""Mentoring,"" as evidenced by their search frequencies of 7, 5, and 5 times respectively. Since three of the keywords from the announcement align with their previous searches, it seems quite likely that the user would be interested in the new announcement.

However, the keyword information for the new announcement includes ""education"" and ""employment."" The user has only searched for ""education"" 7 times, which is relatively low compared to their high search frequency for ""employment support."" Given this discrepancy in interest levels, it seems that the user's interest in the new announcement is ambiguous, as their search history does not strongly align with the relevant keywords of ""education"" and ""employment.""

The new announcement features the keywords ""education,"" ""lecture,"" and ""mentoring."" Given that the user has frequently searched for all three of these keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is indeed interested in the new announcement.

However, the new notice contains the keywords ""Contest,"" ""Essay,"" and ""Literature.""

Given that the user has already searched for ""Contest"" 17 times, it suggests an existing interest in related announcements. While there are no direct searches for ""Essay"" or ""Literature,"" the high frequency of interest in ""Contest"" indicates that the user might still engage with the new notice, especially since the ""Contest"" tag is one of the new notice's keywords. 

Overall, the strong past interest in ""Contest"" and the new keyword's relevance to what the user has previously searched implies that they are likely interested in the new notice, leading to a target score of 1.",1

The user has searched for ""job preparation"" 4 times, which is the only keyword in common with the new announcement. The remainder of the user's search history predominantly revolves around online education, contests, student participation, UCC, meetings, and volunteer activities, none of which aligns with the keywords presented in the new announcement. 

This suggests that while there is a slight connection to ""job preparation,"" the absence of significant searches related to the other keywords in the announcement—web development, backend, mentoring, programming education, and frontend—points towards a lack of strong interest in this particular area.

Considering the user's search history, there are no direct correlations with the new announcement's keywords. The user has shown interest primarily in practical topics related to career development, education, and mentoring, while the new keywords relate to creative aspects (competition, essay, literature).

When considering the new announcement keywords provided—employment, entrepreneurship, education, lecture, mentoring, and internship—it is evident that the user has searched for the keyword ""employment"" three times and ""education"" six times, as well as ""mentoring"" seven times. This indicates a clear interest in these related topics. 

Therefore, it seems likely that the user might be interested in the new announcement, as the keywords from the announcement align with the user's previous searches. Given this analysis, the target score of 1 seems justified in this context.",1

The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""Contest"" 17 times, ""Company Exploration"" 9 times, ""University Job Center"" 7 times, ""Education Program"" 6 times, ""Eligibility"" 6 times, and ""Student Participation"" 5 times. Since the user has shown a strong interest in the ""Contest"" keyword by searching for it 17 times, it indicates a level of engagement with content related to contests. Additionally, there is a possibility of interest in ""Planning"" as a broader concept, but the search history does not provide a direct correlation to that specific keyword. Overall, given the user's frequent searches related to ""Contest,"" it suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement, indicating a target score of 1.",1

This pattern suggests a significant level of interest in these topics.

Considering that the target score is 1, the evidence from the user's search history indicates that they are likely interested in the new announcement.

Given that the user's search history does not include any related tags to ""planning,"" it seems the user does not have a particular interest in this announcement.

However, the new announcement is tagged with keywords ""online education"" and ""student participation."" 

Since the user's search history does not directly include the keywords from the new announcement, it suggests that the specific topics of online education and student participation may not be top-of-mind for this user. Given that none of the keywords align closely with what the user typically searches for, it supports the ""goal score"" of 0, indicating that the user is likely not interested in this announcement. 

Therefore, based on the keywords provided and the user's search behavior, it appears that the user does not have a particular interest in the new announcement.",0

While the user shows a particular interest in ""Trade"" (2 times) and ""Employment"" (3 times), their recent searches do not strongly correlate with many other tags listed in the new announcement. Given that the target score is 0, it appears the user may not have a strong interest in this announcement, as their search history doesn't strongly reflect engagement with the new keywords.

Analyzing the user's search history, they have shown a notable interest in related topics, with 17 searches for ""contest"" and no mentions of ""planning."" The high frequency of searches for ""contest"" indicates a strong interest in that area, while the absence of searches for ""planning"" leaves some uncertainty about their interest in that specific term. Although the user has not searched for ""planning,"" the significant focus on ""contest"" suggests that they may still be inclined to engage with announcements related to contests.

Moreover, the presence of both ""education"" and ""employment"" keywords in the new announcement suggests a high likelihood of interest.

Given that ""education"" is one of the keywords of the new announcement and it matches the user's search behavior, it suggests that the user might have a positive inclination towards the new announcement. The repetition of the ""education"" keyword in their recent search history indicates that they are likely to be interested in related content. 

Since the user has not shown any interaction with the keyword ""visual,"" it creates some ambiguity regarding their interest in that aspect of the announcement.

The new announcement keywords include 'employment preparation', 'employment support', 'recruitment', 'lecture', 'mentoring', and 'educational announcement'. Among these, the user has previously searched for 'lecture' 7 times and 'employment' 4 times, which indicates a certain level of interest in both areas. While the counts for 'employment' and 'lecture' suggest potential curiosity, the user does not have direct matches with keywords like 'employment preparation', 'employment support', or 'mentoring', which might imply varying degrees of relevance.

Considering the overall data, the presence of 'lecture' and 'employment' in the user's search history suggests that they may be interested in the new announcement, given the related topics.

Specifically, they searched for ""competition"" 9 times, ""gathering"" 5 times, and ""volunteer"" 5 times, among others. However, the new announcement features the keywords ""club"" and ""meeting"". 

From the user’s search history, they searched for ""gathering"" (which corresponds to ""모임"") 5 times, indicating some level of interest. However, they do not have a search record for ""club"" (which corresponds to ""동아리""). This suggests that while there may be potential interest in the keyword ""meeting"", the absence of searches for ""club"" makes it uncertain if the user will be interested in the new announcement overall.

Since there is some relevant search activity related to ""meeting"" but no corresponding interest for ""club,"" the user's interest in the new announcement can be considered ambiguous, leading to the conclusion that the likelihood of the user being interested is low. Therefore, the goal rating is 0.",0

Although there are no specific searches for ""educational benefits,"" the frequency of searches for ""online education"" and ""Korea Aerospace University"" suggest that the user may be interested in the new announcement overall. The significant number of searches in related categories points towards a likelihood of interest in the upcoming information, which aligns with a target score of 1.",0
1454,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""education"" and ""employment."" Looking at the user's announcement search history, they have searched for the keyword ""education"" 18 times, which indicates a strong interest in this topic. Additionally, the user has searched for ""lecture"" 11 times, ""reporter group"" 11 times, and ""supporters"" 10 times, but these terms are not directly related to the new announcement.

Since the keyword ""education"" appears frequently in the user's search history and aligns with the new announcement, it suggests that the user is likely interested in the announcement. However, there is no direct evidence of interest in ""employment,"" as this keyword was not mentioned in the search history. Therefore, while the user shows a clear interest in ""education,"" the lack of relevant searches concerning ""employment"" makes it a bit ambiguous regarding the overall interest in the new announcement.

Thus, since the user has shown a significant interest in one of the announcement's keywords, it can be inferred that the user is interested in the new announcement, leading to the target score of 1.",1

Given that the user has searched for the keyword ""contest"" significantly more than any other keyword, it suggests that they have a strong interest in this area. The high frequency of searches for related terms indicates a likelihood of engagement with the new announcement. Therefore, it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement about the contest, supporting a score of 1 for their interest in the information presented.",1

The keywords for the new announcement include ""Meeting,"" ""Club,"" ""University Student Activities,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" ""Volunteering,"" and ""Education."" 

Considering that the user has searched for ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring"" multiple times, it suggests they might have a strong interest in these topics. Additionally, ""Education"" is also a keyword that they have searched for previously, which aligns with the new announcement's keywords. 

However, while they searched for ""University Student"" (6 times), none of the other keywords like ""Meeting,"" ""Club,"" and ""Volunteering"" appear in their search history, which creates some uncertainty. 

Overall, since the user has shown considerable interest in ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Education,"" it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely interested in the new announcement as well, leading to a prediction of interest (1).",1

However, the new announcement has keywords related to ""Semiconductor,"" ""Free Education,"" and ""Tuition Support.""

Since the user's search history does not include any keywords related to the new announcement, it suggests that the user may not have a clear interest in the topics mentioned in the new notice.

The user has shown significant interest in the tags related to the new notice. Specifically, the repeated searches for ""employment,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""internship"" suggest a strong inclination towards topics that are relevant to the new notice. Since the user has searched ""employment"" 4 times and ""internship"" 4 times, this indicates that they are likely interested in these subjects.

Considering the total number of tags searched, it is reasonable to assume that the user has some level of interest in the new notice, particularly regarding ""employment"" and ""internship"" opportunities. Therefore, the user's engagement with similar key topics suggests that they may be interested in the notice, resulting in a target score of 1.",1

The absence of searches for ""planning"" and ""participant qualifications"" suggests that the user does not find these topics relevant to their interests.

The search records show that the user has searched for ""Supporting Members"" 8 times and ""Contest"" 8 times, both of which are among the new announcement's keywords.

The keywords in the new announcement do not directly match any of the frequently searched tags by the user. This indicates that the user has demonstrated a strong interest in recruitment-related topics rather than the educational or employment support themes found in the new announcement.

The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""planning"" 12 times, ""contest"" 7 times, and they have demonstrated a significant interest in these topics. The high frequency of searches for ""planning"" indicates a strong interest, while the searches for ""contest"" further support this notion. Since the user has actively engaged with related keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely interested in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1

The keyword information for the new announcement includes ""Student Participation"" and ""University Job Center."" However, the user's search history does not align closely with these keywords. 

The user has searched ""Student Participation"" a total of 6 times, which shows some interest; however, the other keyword ""University Job Center"" does not appear in their search history at all. This lack of relevance to the second keyword, combined with the moderate interest in ""Student Participation,"" suggests that their overall interest in the new announcement is limited. Thus, despite a slight inclination towards one keyword, the absence of engagement with the other keyword leads to the conclusion that the user is likely not interested in this announcement overall.",0
1465,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a significant interest in the keyword ""공모전"" (competition) by searching for it 18 times in their recent search history. Additionally, they have made searches related to ""UCC"" (User Created Content) 11 times, which could also be of some relevance. However, the keyword ""논문"" (thesis) received no searches in the user's history, indicating a lack of interest. 

Since the primary keyword ""공모전"" has a high search frequency compared to the overall number of searches, it indicates that the user is likely to be interested in this new announcement. On the other hand, the absence of any searches related to ""논문"" means that this part of the announcement may not attract the user's attention. 

Thus, it appears the user is somewhat interested in the new announcement due to their strong interest in ""공모전,"" leading to a likely conclusion of a positive engagement (1), while there remains some ambiguity concerning the relevance of ""논문"" in this context.

The significant frequency of searches for the ""scholarship"" tag indicates that the user is likely interested in scholarship-related announcements. Although ""2024 academic year"" is also frequently searched, it does not directly correspond with the new notice's keywords. Given that the user has actively sought out information about scholarships, it suggests a clear interest in this topic, leading us to conclude that the target rating would be 1, indicating a positive interest in the new notice. 

Therefore, the user's engagement with relevant search keywords and the specific content of the new notice strongly align, reaffirming their interest.",1

Notably, the user has recently searched for the keywords ""competition"" and ""planning"", which indicates a potential interest in the new announcement. 

Given that the user has actively searched for ""competition"" (15 times) and ""planning"" (11 times), it seems likely that they would be interested in the new announcement with similar keywords. Therefore, the target score of 1 seems justified as the user's search history aligns closely with the keywords present in the new announcement.",1

Although the user has searched for related tags such as ""Recruitment Announcement"" and ""Competition,"" none of their search history indicates a specific interest in contests, with the most relevant search term being ""public competition,"" which they searched for only 3 times. 

Furthermore, despite having a considerable number of searches related to job support and training, these topics do not align directly with the keyword ""Contest."" Since the user has looked up contests fewer times than other keywords, it suggests they are not particularly interested in this announcement.

The user has a search history that includes the keyword ""education"" searched 28 times and the keyword ""lecture"" (which may relate to ""management"") searched 22 times. Since the user has frequently searched for ""education,"" it indicates a strong interest in this topic. Although the keyword ""trade"" does not appear in the user's search history, the user's repeated searches for ""education"" and the related term suggest that they are likely interested in the announcement.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in ""education"" with 24 searches, it suggests a strong likelihood that the user is interested in the new announcement related to education. Although there is no search history for ""lecture,"" the dominant interest in ""education"" supports the notion that the user may be keen to explore any announcements related to that field. 

Therefore, considering the user's keyword search history and the new announcement's keywords, it is reasonable to infer that the user has an interest in the announcement, leading to a target score of 1.",1

The user has shown a significant interest in “planning” and “contest,” evidenced by their multiple searches for these keywords. Given that the new announcement includes two keywords (“planning” and “contest”) that the user has actively searched for, it seems likely that they would have an interest in this announcement.

Considering that there are no direct matches between the user's search history and the new notice's keywords, it appears that the user does not have a strong interest in the latest announcement. The user's previous searches primarily revolve around educational activities and events, which do not seem to align with the themes of clubs, meetings, or volunteering.

While the user has shown interest in ""Education,"" which is one of the keywords from the new notice, the absence of searches related to the other keywords suggests that the user may not find the new notice engaging. The predominant focus on topics like ""Event"" and ""Marketing"" implies that the user's interests are more aligned with those areas rather than the content suggested by the new notice. Consequently, due to this mismatch and the lack of relevant searches for major keywords associated with the new notice, it is logical to conclude that the user is not interested in the new notice.",0

The significant search frequency for ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring"" indicates that the user has a clear interest in content related to these topics. Additionally, the presence of the keyword ""Education"" in both the announcement and the search history further suggests a connection. However, the user did not show any specific interest in ""Free Education"" and ""Recruitment of Students"" since these keywords do not appear in their search history.

However, the new announcement's keywords include ""employment,"" ""bootcamp,"" and ""design.""

Since the ""employment"" keyword is also part of the new announcement and the user has shown significant interest in this area through multiple searches, it indicates a potential interest in the upcoming notification. However, the keywords ""bootcamp"" and ""design"" were not part of the user's previous searches, which introduces uncertainty regarding their interest in those specific areas.

Given that the user has a strong history of searching for ""employment"" related topics, this suggests that they may indeed have an interest in the new announcement, particularly in its relevance to their ongoing job search efforts.

The new announcement contains the keywords ""접수기간"" (Application Period), ""국제교류"" (International Exchange), and ""계약직"" (Contract Position). Given that the user has shown consistent interest in the ""국제교류"" keyword, it indicates a certain level of interest in the new announcement.

However, the user has not searched for the keywords ""접수기간"" and ""계약직,"" which makes the overall interest in the new announcement less clear.

However, the new announcement keywords are ""Ministry of Employment and Labor"" and ""COVID-19."" There is no direct correlation between the user's previous searches and these new keywords. The user's interests appear to be more focused on various educational topics and technology, rather than labor or health-related announcements.

Given that the target score is 0, it suggests that the user likely does not have any interest in these particular announcement keywords, as they do not align with the user's documented search history. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the user is not interested in the new announcement.",0
1494,"Based on the given information, the user's search history reveals a strong interest in various tags related to student participation, academic year, and benefits. Specifically, the user has searched for ""education"" 3 times, which corresponds to one of the keywords of the new notice. However, the tag ""employment,"" which is another keyword of the new notice, does not appear in the user's search history at all. 

While the user has shown interest in education, their apparent lack of interest in employment suggests that they might not find this new notice as compelling. Hence, since the user only has a limited connection to one of the relevant keywords but zero association with the other, we conclude that they are likely not interested in the new notice overall, which aligns with the target score of 0.",0
1495,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 1, indicating that they are interested in the newly announced information. The new announcement contains keywords ""contest"" and ""UCC."" 

The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""contest"" 13 times and ""UCC"" 11 times. This suggests a strong interest in both topics, with multiple searches indicating a higher level of engagement. The fact that they have searched for ""contest"" significantly more than any other tag demonstrates a clear inclination towards announcements related to contests. 

On the other hand, while the user has also shown a considerable interest in ""UCC"" with 11 searches, the number of searches for ""contest"" indicates an even stronger affinity. This combined interest in both relevant keywords supports the conclusion that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Thus, the user's historical behavior aligns well with their goal score of 1, reflecting their engagement with content related to the new keywords.",1
1496,"Based on the given information, the user's interest in the new notice appears to be low, resulting in a target score of 0.

Since the user has searched for the ""competition"" tag 15 times and the ""planning"" tag 11 times, it indicates that they are indeed interested in these topics. The repeated searches suggest a consistent level of engagement with these keywords.

The user's search history shows a significant interest in these topics with ""Education"" searched 10 times, ""Mentoring"" searched 8 times, and ""Lecture"" searched 6 times. Since the user has repeatedly searched for these related keywords, it strongly indicates that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement. Hence, the target score of 1 seems justified, reflecting the user's engagement with the relevant topics.",1

However, the new announcement's keywords—""event,"" ""supporters,"" and "" 행사""—do not appear in the user's search history.

Given that the user has not shown any interest in the specific keywords of the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user likely does not have an interest in this announcement, which is reflected in the target score of 0. Therefore, the absence of relevant searches suggests that the user is not inclined towards the topics presented in the new announcement.",0

The user’s search history shows 31 times for the keyword ""COVID-19"" and 19 times for ""contest."" This indicates a strong interest in these topics. However, since there are no relevant keywords in the new announcement, it is understandable why the user might not find this new information appealing.

While the first term, ""education,"" is somewhat related to the ""education program"" in the new announcement, there are no direct searches for “career exploration.” This suggests that although the user is interested in education-related topics, their specific interest in the new announcement's keywords is unclear.

The user has shown considerable interest in both ""cloud"" and ""server,"" which are part of the new announcement's keywords.

Although the keyword ""employment"" does not appear in the user's search history, the significant searches for ""cloud"" and ""server"" suggest that the user is likely to be interested in news or information related to these concepts.

The new announcement keywords are ""contact,"" ""lecture,"" ""job support,"" ""start-up,"" ""job preparation,"" ""education,"" ""internship,"" ""employment,"" and ""mentoring."" 

Since the user has searched for ""job support"" 4 times and ""mentoring"" 3 times, both of which match the new announcement's keywords, it indicates that the user may have an interest in this announcement. While there are also searches related to ""education,"" the direct keywords present in the new announcement stand out. Therefore, the user's behavior suggests a positive inclination towards the new announcement, supporting the target score of 1.",1
1505,"Based on the given information, the user has shown significant interest in certain tags within their recent search history. The user has searched for the ""Supporters"" tag 10 times, the ""Press Corps"" tag 11 times, and the ""Lecture"" tag 11 times, which suggests that they may have a moderate interest in these areas. 

The new announcement contains the keywords ""Supporters,"" ""Press Corps,"" and ""Contact Information."" Since the user has previously searched for the ""Press Corps"" and ""Supporters"" tags multiple times, it indicates that they likely have a strong interest in these topics. 

Given that the user has engaged with both relevant tags present in the new notice, it is reasonable to conclude that they would be interested in this announcement, as both the keywords and their search frequency align positively. Therefore, the target rating of 1 accurately reflects the user's interest in the new announcement.",1

However, the new announcement has keywords related to ""contact"" and ""application guide"". Given that none of the user's previous search history aligns with the new tags, it suggests that the user likely has no interest in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score is 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new information provided.",0
1507,"Based on the given information, the user's interest in the new announcement can be assessed through the analysis of the provided keyword information and their search history. The new announcement features the keywords ""Education,"" ""Announcement,"" and ""AI.""

The user's search history reveals significant interest in related topics, specifically with 17 searches for ""Competition,"" which could correlate with the keyword ""Announcement,"" and 6 searches for ""Educational Program,"" aligning with the ""Education"" keyword. However, there is no direct mention of the ""AI"" keyword in the user's search records, which leaves some ambiguity regarding their interest in that specific area.

Considering the substantial number of searches for ""Competition"" and ""Educational Program,"" it suggests that the user might be interested in the new announcement, particularly because these areas overlap with the new keywords provided. However, the absence of searches related to ""AI"" indicates only a partial alignment with the new announcement's focus.

Therefore, it could be inferred that, while the user shows interest in some aspects of the new announcement, the lack of specific queries related to ""AI"" makes it less clear whether they are fully engaged with the entirety of the announcement. This complexity leads to the conclusion that the likelihood of user interest reflects a mixed perspective, ultimately supporting the ""goal score"" of 0, indicating low interest overall.",0
1508,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates that they have shown interest in various tags with the following counts: 11 times for ""visual"", 10 times for ""education"", 9 times for ""employment"", 6 times for ""lecture"", 4 times for ""meeting"", 3 times for ""internship"", 2 times for ""reporter group"", 2 times for ""supporters"", 2 times for ""planning"", and 1 time for ""mentoring"".

The new announcement includes the following keywords: ""cybersecurity"", ""education program"", ""employment link"", ""lecture"", ""mentoring"", ""education"", and ""recruitment of trainees"".

The keyword ""education"" appears 10 times in the user's search history, which suggests that the user has significant interest in this area. Additionally, the keywords ""mentoring"" and ""lecture"" also align with the user's search history, as they have searched for ""mentoring"" once and ""lecture"" six times. Furthermore, the keyword ""employment"" is relevant as well, with 9 searches recorded.

Given the strong overlap between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords, particularly in educational and mentorship contexts, it can be logically inferred that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Thus, the target score of 1 seems accurate here, indicating that the user is indeed interested in the new announcement.",1
1509,"Based on the given information, the target score is 0, indicating that the user is not interested in the new announcement. The new announcement contains keywords related to ""recruitment of trainees,"" ""education,"" and ""free education.""

The user has not searched for keywords directly related to the new announcement, specifically the terms ""trainee recruitment,"" ""education,"" or ""free education."" Given that the relevant keywords appear to be absent from the user's search history, it suggests a lack of interest in this particular announcement.

The user's search history shows a significant interest in relevant topics, with ""education"" being searched 11 times and ""employment"" 7 times. The repeated searches for ""education"" and ""employment"" indicate a strong potential interest in announcements related to these subjects. The term ""curriculum"" is not directly reflected in the user's search history, but given their active interest in ""education,"" it is reasonable to suggest that they may be interested in curriculum-related announcements as well.

1513,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keyword ""competition."" The user's search history shows that they have searched for keywords related to ""competition"" 16 times, which is the highest frequency among their recent searches.

Additionally, the user has shown some interest in ""인턴"" (Internship) by searching for it 2 times, which aligns with the new notice's keywords as well. 

Since the search records include keywords that are directly related to the new notice, it suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the announcement. The presence of these overlapping tags, particularly with multiple searches, indicates a positive correlation between the user's preferences and the content of the new notice. Therefore, the target score of 1 is justified, suggesting that the user is interested in the new announcement.",1
1515,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains keywords: education, club, and application method. The user's search history includes 13 searches for education, 6 searches for club, and no searches for application method. 

Since the user has shown significant interest in the education keyword, which is highly relevant to the new notice, it suggests a strong likelihood that the user is interested in the new notice. Additionally, the user has made some searches related to clubs, indicating a partial interest in that area as well. 

Overall, the combination of the user's extensive searches for education and some searches for club indicates that the user is likely interested in the new notice, leading to a target rating of 1.",1

Since the user has frequently searched for ""education"" and ""bootcamp,"" it suggests an interest in those areas. Specifically, the user has searched for ""education"" 14 times, which indicates a strong interest, and has searched for ""bootcamp"" 6 times, further showing potential interest in that topic as well. However, there is no record of searches related to ""AI."" 

Given this information, it can be inferred that the user is likely interested in the new notice, particularly due to their previous searches related to ""education"" and ""bootcamp."" Therefore, the target score of 1 indicates that the user appears to have an interest in the notice.",1

The user has shown a significant interest in education and employment, as evidenced by the high frequency of searches for these keywords. Specifically, the user searched the term ""employment"" 17 times and ""education"" 14 times, indicating a strong engagement with topics related to these areas.

There are no searches related to ""curriculum"" or ""backend"" in their 50 recent searches.

The user has not searched for any of the new announcement keywords: ""scholarships,"" ""international exchange,"" or ""student recruitment.""

However, the newly provided announcement keyword is ""naming,"" which does not relate well to the user's previous search history.

Since the user has not shown any interest in the specific keyword ""naming"" in their search history, which includes tags predominantly focused on student-related topics, it indicates that the user is not likely to be interested in this announcement.

Given that there are no strong keywords in the new announcement, it raises doubts about whether the user will find it interesting or relevant to their previous search history.

Although they have searched for this keyword multiple times, it is not among the most frequently searched terms compared to others like ""모집 공고"" (6 times) and ""강연"" (5 times). This indicates a moderate interest in the topic, but due to the overall more extensive focus on other subjects, it is somewhat ambiguous whether they are particularly interested in announcements specifically related to ""2024학년도.""

Since none of the user's search records match these new keywords, it suggests that the user may not have any direct interest in the content of the announcement.

Instead, their recent searches primarily revolved around topics such as ""backend"" (6 times), ""employment"" (5 times), and ""cloud"" (4 times), among others related to programming and job preparation.

This suggests that the user has a strong interest in different aspects of technical education and employment opportunities, but the absence of searches related to ""supporters"" and ""application method"" implies a lack of interest in the new announcement. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to show interest in this announcement, as indicated by the target score of 0.",0

The tags include ""contest"" (13 times), ""essay"" (11 times), ""game"" (10 times), ""supporters"" (7 times), ""planning"" (5 times), and ""poster"" (4 times). However, the new announcement's keywords are ""bootcamp"" and ""AI,"" which do not match any of the user's recent searches.

Since the user has not searched for either ""bootcamp"" or ""AI,"" this suggests that they might not have a strong interest in this particular announcement. The absence of relevant tag searches makes it likely that the user is not interested in the announcement, which aligns with the provided target score of 0.

The user's recent search history shows a significant interest in related topics, with ""education"" searched 8 times, ""employment"" searched 5 times, and ""AI"" searched 5 times. The high frequency of searches for ""education"" in particular suggests that the user is likely interested in the new notice. The presence of multiple searches for terms directly related to the notice indicates a strong correlation between the user's interests and the content of the new notice.

The new announcement contains the keywords: ""Contact,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Employment Support,"" ""Startup,"" ""Job Preparation,"" ""Education,"" ""Internship,"" ""Employment,"" and ""Mentoring.""

In this case, we can observe that the user has searched for the keywords ""Lecture"" 4 times, ""Employment"" 3 times, and ""Mentoring"" 7 times, which align with the new announcement keywords. The repeated searches for ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Employment"" suggest that the user has a significant interest in these topics, indicating a likelihood of their interest in the new announcement.

Therefore, considering the repeated searches for related keywords, it can be inferred that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, reflected by a target score of 1.",1

The frequent searches for ""Contest"" suggest that the user has a considerable interest in this area, which aligns with one of the new announcement's keywords. However, the overwhelming focus on ""COVID-19"" with 31 searches highlights a potential disconnect from the new topics in this announcement. 

Given this mix of interests, it appears that while the user might show some level of interest in the new announcement, particularly due to the ""Contest"" keyword, the strong inclination toward ""COVID-19"" suggests their primary focus may lie elsewhere. Hence, it is somewhat ambiguous whether the user will engage with this new announcement. The target score indicating the user’s interest may lean towards 0, reflecting the uncertainty of their interest in the new information.",1
1541,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains keywords including planning, contest, and application period. The user's search records indicate a high interest in contests with 17 searches, followed by UCC with 6 searches, and several other tags like supporters, awards, participation, and events with various frequencies. 

Since the keyword ""contest"" closely aligns with the user's most frequently searched term, it suggests a strong interest in this area. The keyword ""application period"" is represented in the search records as well, with 2 searches noted. However, the keyword ""planning"" does not appear in the user's search history, which may indicate a lack of interest in that specific aspect.

Additionally, the term ""기획"" (planning) does not appear in the user's search history, suggesting less interest in this specific keyword. Despite this, the strong focus on ""공모전"" suggests that the user is likely interested in the new notice, as their extensive search history reflects a clear preference for competitions.

The user's search history includes the keywords as follows: ""Supporters"" searched 19 times, ""Marketing"" searched 8 times, ""Application Method"" searched 8 times, ""Press Corps"" searched 8 times, and ""Activity Benefits"" searched 7 times. 

Considering that the user frequently searched for the term ""Supporters,"" it indicates a strong interest in this area. Additionally, the user has also shown interest in the ""Press Corps"" keyword, having searched for it 8 times. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, which matches two keywords related to their previous searches.

With significant searches in both the ""lecture"" and ""mentoring"" categories (8 and 7 times respectively), along with the tag ""education"" being searched 4 times, it indicates strong relevance to the new announcement's keywords. 

Given this data, the user likely has an interest in the new announcement, and the target score of 1 aligns with this assessment.",1

The new announcement keywords include ""meeting"", ""club"", ""college student activities"", ""lecture"", ""mentoring"", ""volunteering"", and ""education"".

The user has expressed significant interest in ""education"" with a frequency of 13 searches, indicating a strong inclination towards educational content. Moreover, they have searched for ""club"" 6 times, which directly correlates with one of the keywords of the new announcement. While there are other keywords such as ""meeting"", ""college student activities"", ""lecture"", ""mentoring"", and ""volunteering"", the strong interest in ""education"" and the relevant search for ""club"" suggest that the user is likely to find the new announcement appealing. 

Thus, the combination of the user's frequent searches related to education and the direct relevance of their search for clubs points towards their potential interest in the new announcement, reinforcing the goal score of 1.",1

Although the user has demonstrated some interest in related content by searching for ""Education,"" the absence of searches for ""Lecture"" makes it unclear whether they have a specific interest in this particular notice. The moderate interest in ""Education"" could signal that the user might show some level of interest in the new notice, but since the focus on ""Lecture"" is missing, it leans towards the possibility that the user may not be particularly interested in this announcement.

Therefore, given the mixture of slightly relevant search activity and the absence of direct engagement with the specific keywords, the interest level remains ambiguous, suggesting the target score of 0 indicates a lack of strong interest in this new notice.",0

Since the user has not searched for the keywords 'Supporters' or 'Employment' in their recent search history, there appears to be a disconnect between the user's interests and the new announcement. The lack of related searches in the user's history indicates that they are likely not interested in the new announcement, supporting the ""target score"" of 0. The keywords in the announcement do not align with any of the user's previously expressed interests, reinforcing the idea that the user may not have any curiosity or engagement regarding this new information.",0

Notably, the user has shown a strong interest in the keyword ""AI,"" which matches one of the keywords from the new announcement.

However, the new announcement includes ""Big Data"" as its second keyword, and there is no evidence in the user's search history to suggest any prior interest in ""Big Data."" This suggests that while the user may have a significant interest in the area of ""AI,"" the absence of any searches related to ""Big Data"" makes it unclear if they would find the overall announcement appealing.

Thus, based on the combination of their relevant searches and the provided keywords, it seems that the user's interest may align more closely with ""AI,"" leading to the conclusion that they are likely interested in the announcement, but the lack of interest in ""Big Data"" creates some uncertainty. Therefore, the ""target score"" of 0 suggests that the user does not have a strong enough inclination towards both keywords of the new announcement to justify definite interest.",0

Although the user has shown significant interest in ""education"" with 13 searches, the search history does not indicate any interest in the keywords ""poster"" and ""event."" This suggests that while there is a strong positive correlation with ""education,"" the absence of interest in the other two keywords diminishes the likelihood of the user being fully engaged with the new announcement. Therefore, considering the mixed interests, it seems that the user's interest might be potentially low, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

However, the new notice contains keywords related to ""Planning"" and ""Contest.""

The absence of searches for the keywords ""Planning"" and ""Contest"" in the user's recent history indicates a lack of engagement with these specific topics.

Since the user has not shown any specific interest in application methods based on their previous searches, it suggests that they are unlikely to be interested in this new announcement. Therefore, considering the lack of relevant search history, the model's predicted score of interest would be 0.",0

Among these keywords, ""취업"" appears to correlate with ""employment,"" which the user has searched 7 times. Additionally, ""교육"" has also been searched 8 times.

While the terms ""포트폴리오,"" ""창업,"" ""강연,"" and ""멘토링"" are not present in the user's recent search history, the significant frequency of searches for ""취업"" and ""교육"" suggests a likelihood of interest in the new announcement, especially given that ""취업"" and ""인턴"" are directly related to the user’s previous searches. Therefore, based on this analysis, it can be inferred that the user likely has an interest in the new announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1

In this case, the user has searched for both ""Server"" and ""Backend"" which appear in the new announcement's keywords. The user has searched for ""Server"" 6 times and ""Backend"" 6 times. Additionally, the user has shown interest in ""Cloud"" as they searched for it 8 times, which is also a keyword in the new announcement.

Considering these factors, it appears that the user has a notable level of interest in the areas covered by the new announcement, especially in Server, Backend, and Cloud services. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in this new notice. Hence, the target score is 1.",1

The new announcement's keywords are ""contest,"" ""essay,"" and ""literature.""

Given that the user has searched the keyword ""contest"" significantly (17 times), it indicates strong interest in this area. However, there are no searches recorded for ""essay"" and ""literature,"" which suggests that the user might not have interest in those topics. Therefore, while there is a clear interest in ""contest,” the lack of searches for the other two keywords makes it unclear whether the user would be interested in the new announcement in its entirety.

In conclusion, while it can be inferred that the user has an interest in contests, the overall interest in the new announcement is less certain due to the absence of related searches for ""essay"" and ""literature."" This complexity leads to the possibility that the user may have an interest likely reflected in a score of 1, but given the lack of comprehensive interest, it could also lean towards a score of 0.

However, while ""AI"" is present in the search history, it is not the most frequently searched term, as the user has shown more interest in ""봉사"" (9 times) and ""모임"" (6 times). This suggests that while the user has some interest in AI, it does not appear to be a primary focus based on the frequency of searches. Therefore, the model may determine that user interest is somewhat ambiguous, leaning towards a lack of strong interest in this specific announcement. Thus, the target score appears to be 0.",0

The user has searched for AI and Cloud multiple times, which directly correlates with the new announcement's keywords. The 6 searches each for Backend and Server further show a strong interest in these relevant categories. While the user's search also lacks mention of certain specific keywords like Frontend and Java, the overall high frequency of searches related to the new announcement suggests a likely interest in it.

Given that the user has actively searched for the keyword ""visual"" the most, followed by ""employment,"" and has shown some interest in ""internship,"" it suggests that the user is indeed interested in the new announcement.

The user's search history contains several keywords with varying frequencies, notably ""Supporters"" with 1 time, ""Employment"" with 2 times, and relevant tags like ""Student Recruitment"" and ""External Activities"" not mentioned in their search history. 

Given that the user has searched for ""Employment"" twice, there is a slight indication of interest in announcements related to job opportunities.

The lack of searches for ""Student Recruitment,"" ""External Activities,"" ""Press Corps,"" ""Startups,"" and ""Internship"" suggests that these topics may not capture the user's attention.

Overall, the user's search history presents a mixed picture. Although there is some interest indicated by the searches for ""Employment"" and ""Supporters,"" the absence of searches for the other keywords means it would be ambiguous to conclude that the user is significantly interested in the new announcement.

The absence of any searches related to ""Other Support"" and ""General Public"" suggests that the user does not find these topics relevant or interesting to their needs. Since the user's previous searches indicate a preference for specific fields such as employment support and design, it can be concluded that they are unlikely to be interested in the current announcement's keywords.

This discrepancy suggests that while the user has engaged heavily with support and press-related content, there is no overlap with the keywords of the new announcement.

1574,"Based on the given information, the user's search history includes keywords such as ""education"" (11 times), ""semiconductor"" (10 times), ""blockchain"" (5 times), ""lecture"" (5 times), ""youth"" (5 times), ""free education"" (4 times), ""online education"" (4 times), ""contest"" (3 times), and ""AI"" (3 times). 

The new announcement's keywords are ""supporters,"" ""lecture,"" ""reporter group,"" ""content creation,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""education."" The user has shown significant interest in the ""education"" and ""lecture"" keywords within their search history. Specifically, they have searched ""education"" 11 times and ""lecture"" 5 times, indicating a clear interest in these topics.

Given this pattern, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to have an interest in the new announcement, especially due to the presence of ""lecture"" and ""education"" in both the new keywords and the user's search history. Therefore, the objective score of 1 (interest) seems appropriate in this context.",1
1575,"Based on the given information, the user has shown interest in various keywords related to the announcements they have searched. The user searched for ""server"" 11 times, ""cloud"" 10 times, and ""education"" 4 times, among others. The new announcement consists of the keywords ""education,"" ""server,"" and ""cloud."" 

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""server"" and ""cloud"" (both of which are included in the new announcement), it indicates a strong interest in these topics. Although the user has searched ""education"" less (only 4 times), its presence in the new announcement adds to the relevance of the information. 

Therefore, considering the user's previous search history and the relevant keywords from the new announcement, it seems likely that the user is interested in this announcement, which explains the score of 1 for the target value.",1
1576,"Based on the given information, the user's search history includes tags related to ""job support,"" ""games,"" ""blockchain,"" ""education,"" and more. Specifically, the user has searched for ""education"" 5 times and other tags related to job support multiple times. However, the new announcement contains keywords ""education"" and ""club."" 

The user's interest in the ""education"" tag, with 5 searches, suggests a solid level of engagement with topics related to education. However, there is no mention of the ""club"" tag in their search history, which makes it difficult to ascertain their interest in that aspect.

Given that the ""education"" tag is present in both the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords, one could argue that the user is likely to have some interest in the new announcement. However, due to the absence of the ""club"" tag in their searches, the user's overall interest remains somewhat ambiguous.

Thus, considering the available data, it might be concluded that the user may have moderate interest, leaning towards a score of 1 (indicating interest), but with some uncertainty regarding the ""club"" aspect.",0

The new announcement contains the keywords ""supporter,"" ""activity benefits,"" and ""reporter group."" Given that the user has shown interest in the keyword ""supporter"" by searching for it 22 times, it indicates a significant level of interest in that topic. However, the user has not searched for ""activity benefits"" or ""reporter group"" at all, creating some ambiguity about their interest in those specific topics. Nevertheless, since the user has engaged consistently with the ""supporter"" tag, it suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion of a target score of 1 (indicating interest).",1

Given that these tags do not align with any significant keywords in the new announcement, it leads to the conclusion that there is little to no connection between the user's interests and the new content. Therefore, it seems that the user is not inclined to engage with this announcement.",0
1579,"Based on the given information, the target score is 0, indicating that the user is not interested in the new announcement. The keyword information for the new notice includes ""competition"" and ""essay.""

Specifically, the user searched for ""cloud infrastructure"" 6 times, ""big data"" 6 times, and has several searches related to ""AI"" and ""security."" None of these searches align with the themes of ""competition"" or ""essay."" This discrepancy between the new announcement's keywords and the user's search patterns suggests a lack of interest, resulting in the target score of 0. 

In summary, the absence of relevant searches in the user's history for the keywords ""competition"" and ""essay"" indicates that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new public notice.",0

The new announcement contains the keywords ""scholarship"" and ""student support."" 

Since the user searched for ""scholarships"" a significant number of times, it indicates that they have a strong interest in that topic. Additionally, although there are no direct searches for ""student support,"" the presence of ""scholarships"" in the announcement strongly suggests that the user is likely to be interested in this new information. 

Therefore, the target score of 1 reflects that the user is indeed likely to have an interest in the new announcement.",1

While there is a notable interest in the education sector, none of the searches correspond directly with the new notice's keywords.

Since the user has shown no indication of searching for ""Scholarship,"" ""University Students,"" or ""Vocational College,"" it suggests that they are unlikely to be interested in the new notice. Therefore, the goal score of 0 would be appropriate in this case.",0

The user has searched ""career exploration"" 10 times, ""extracurricular programs"" 7 times, and ""university job centers"" 7 times, but none of the recorded searches align with the keywords of the new notice. 

Since the user has exhibited a clear interest in different subjects that do not relate to education, trade, or management, it is reasonable to conclude that the user does not have interest in the new notice.

However, the new announcement lacks any significant keywords. This absence of important keywords makes it difficult to ascertain the user's interest in the announcement. Although the user has expressed interest in tags related to education and development through their search history, the lack of relevant keywords in the announcement leads to some ambiguity. Thus, it appears that the user is unlikely to have a strong interest in this particular announcement, aligning with the goal score of 0.",0
1586,"Based on the given information, the user's ""goal score"" is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new notice. The user's notice search history includes tags such as ""Supporters"" (6 times), ""Competition"" (5 times), ""Planning"" (4 times), ""Press Corps"" (3 times), among others, totalling 50 entries. However, the new notice has no significant keywords associated with it, leading to ambiguity regarding user interest.

Given that the new notice lacks important keywords, it suggests that it may not resonate with the user’s established interests reflected in their search history. For instance, while the user has shown a strong inclination towards ""Supporters"" and ""Competition,"" these interests do not align with any notable keywords in the new notice. This mismatch reinforces the conclusion that the user is unlikely to find the new notice appealing, as there is no relevant content to engage their interest.

However, the new announcement contains keywords ""Other Support"" and ""Youth,"" which are quite different from the tags previously searched. Given that the user has not shown any interest in these specific keywords and there is no record of related searches, it suggests a lack of interest in the new announcement.

The new notification contains keywords that align closely with these interests, particularly ""job support,"" ""government support,"" ""backend,"" and ""frontend."" This direct overlap indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the new notification as well, justifying the target score of 1, as there is substantial supporting evidence from their search history. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user has a strong inclination towards this new announcement, enhancing the likelihood of their engagement with the provided information.",1

The presence of ""competition"" in both the keyword search history and the new announcement suggests that the user may have an interest in competitions. However, there are no searches for ""application method"" or ""planning,"" indicating limited interest in those specific aspects of the new announcement. 

Given that the user has searched for ""competition"" 11 times, it is reasonable to infer that they might be interested in the new announcement. However, the lack of searches related to the other keywords makes it uncertain whether the user's interest extends fully to the new announcement. Thus, the decision to assign a score of 0 reflects a general uncertainty about the user’s interest based on the overall context provided.",0
1590,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates a strong interest in various topics related to the new notice. The keywords associated with the new notice are ""education,"" ""lecture,"" and ""mentoring."" 

The user has searched for ""education"" 12 times, ""lecture"" 5 times, and ""mentoring"" 4 times. This shows a significant engagement with ""education,"" which is directly aligned with one of the new notice's keywords. The user's repeated searches for ""lecture"" and ""mentoring"" also demonstrate a notable interest, albeit to a lesser extent.

Therefore, based on the high frequency of searches for relevant keywords, it can logically be concluded that the user is likely interested in the new notice, represented by the target score of 1.",1

The new announcement contains the keywords ""education,"" ""participation,"" and ""lecture."" 

The user has shown considerable interest in ""education"" and ""lecture,"" which align perfectly with the keywords in the new announcement. Searching ""education"" 11 times indicates a strong interest, while searching ""lecture"" 10 times also suggests significant engagement with that topic. 

Moreover, although ""participation"" has not been directly searched in the records, it could be inferred that it might relate to the user's interest in these educational activities. Overall, the evidence suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement due to their frequent searches related to the announcement's keywords.

Therefore, based on this analysis, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement regarding education and lectures, supporting a positive objective score of 1.",1

Given that the user has searched for ""planning"" and ""contest,"" which are both present in the announcement's keywords, it is clear that they may have an interest in the new announcement. The high frequency of searches for these tags, particularly ""planning"" and ""contest,"" suggests that the user is likely looking for information related to these specific topics.

Among these, the user has searched for ""education"" and ""lecture"" a total of 12 and 7 times, respectively.

Given that the user has expressed significant interest in both ""education"" and ""lecture,"" and also a notable interest in ""employment,"" it seems likely that they may have a positive interest in the new announcement, particularly because ""employment"" is one of the keywords present.

Specifically, the user has searched for the tag ""education"" 12 times and for the tag ""lecture"" 7 times in their notice search history. This indicates a strong interest in topics related to education and lectures.

Since the new notice contains the keywords ""education"" and ""lecture,"" which align perfectly with the user's past searches, it suggests that the user is likely interested in this notice.

Moreover, the keyword ""participation"" appeared only once, while ""employment"" is more general and does not match their recent searches well.

However, since there are no relevant keywords in the new announcement, it is likely that the user will not find the current announcement appealing, despite their previous searches related to other topics.

The new announcement includes the keywords ""employment support,"" ""boot camp,"" and ""educational program."" 

Given that the user has previously searched for the keyword ""employment support"" 8 times, ""boot camp"" 6 times, and ""educational program"" 5 times, it suggests that the user has some level of interest in these topics. The fact that the user frequently searches for ""employment"" and ""education"" indicates a likelihood of them being engaged with related announcements. 

Therefore, since the user has shown interest in the keywords present in the new announcement, it can be concluded that they are likely interested in this new notice. Hence, the predicted target score would be 1, indicating that the user is interested in the new announcement.",1

The user searched for ""contest"" 18 times, ""UCC"" 11 times, ""essay"" 7 times, ""application period"" 6 times, ""credit exchange"" 4 times, and ""current students"" 4 times. Since none of the searched keywords align with the new notice's keywords, it implies that the user does not have an interest in the new notice content.

Given this discrepancy, it appears that the user does not have a direct interest in the new announcement based on their historical search behavior. The absence of any relevant matches between the searched tags and the new keywords leads to the conclusion that the user likely does not find the new announcement appealing or relevant to their interests.

However, the user's recent search history shows that they have queried tags like ""Recruitment Guide"" 14 times, ""Current Students"" 13 times, ""Student Support"" 12 times, and ""International Exchange"" 11 times. 

This suggests that the user has shown a consistent interest in topics related to student recruitment and support, rather than educational programs or AI education.

Given that ""Supporters"" is one of the keywords in the new announcement and the user has repeatedly searched for this keyword, it suggests that the user is likely interested in this announcement, leading to a positive assessment with a score of 1. The user's frequent engagement with the keyword indicates they are engaged with the topic and likely to be receptive to new announcements related to it.",1

Given that the user has shown a strong interest in keywords closely related to the new notice—particularly ""education,"" ""lecture,"" and ""event""—it suggests that there is a positive correlation between the user's search behavior and the keywords in the new notice. This trend indicates that the user is likely interested in the new notice, warranting a target score of 1.",1

In particular, they have shown a significant interest in ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""curriculum,"" all of which are also present in the new announcement's keywords.

This consistent pattern of search behavior suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. The presence of closely related keywords in both the search history and the new announcement reinforces this conclusion.

Reviewing the user's search history, we see the following relevant tags: Server (9 times), Cloud (8 times), AI (6 times), Security (6 times), Ministry of Employment and Labor (6 times), and Big Data (5 times). The frequency of these searches suggests a strong interest in these topics, especially with Server and Cloud being the most frequently searched tags. 

With several overlapping keywords, including Security and AI which are also tagged in the new announcement, it can be inferred that the user is quite likely to be interested in this announcement based on their search patterns. The combination of the high frequency of relevant searches aligns well with the topics presented in the announcement, further affirming the user's likely interest.",1

The new notice contains keywords related to ""scholarship,"" ""elementary students,"" and ""middle school students,"" which align well with the user's previous search activity.

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""scholarship,"" it strongly suggests a genuine interest in this type of information. Furthermore, the presence of searches for both ""elementary students"" and ""middle school students"" reflects an openness to related content. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in this notice, which corresponds to the target score of 1.",1

The new notice also includes the keyword ""supporters"" (서포터즈), but there is no indication from the user's searching behavior that they are interested in that topic, as it does not appear in their past searches.

Since ""contest"" is the primary keyword of the new notice and the user has demonstrated significant interest in it, the logical conclusion is that the user is likely interested in the new notice.

Furthermore, the user's significant interest in other keywords such as ""credit exchange,"" ""planning,"" ""backend,"" and several event-related tags suggests that their focus may not align with the new announcement's themes.

Although the user has searched for ""education,"" the absence of related keywords that directly connect to ""employment"" and the overall lack of predominant searches for anything closely resembling ""employment"" leads us to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in this particular announcement.

Given that the user has searched for Job Support more than any other tag, it indicates a strong interest in that area. The repeated searches for Design and Web Publisher also suggest a notable level of interest in those topics. Consequently, since the new notification includes all three tags that the user has actively searched for, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in this notification, supporting the goal score of 1.",1

While the user searched for ""Internship"" 6 times and ""Employment"" 7 times, these do not directly correlate with the keywords of the new notice. However, the significant number of searches for ""Education"" suggests a high likelihood of interest in the new notice.

The presence of the keyword ""contest"" in both the search history and the new announcement suggests that the user shows significant interest in contests, as they have searched for this keyword 19 times. However, the keyword ""planning"" does not appear in the user's past searches, making it uncertain whether the user is interested in that aspect.

Considering that the user has a strong history of searching for contests, it is reasonable to infer that they might be interested in this new announcement, thus leading to a ""goal score"" of 1.

However, the new announcement has keywords ""contact"" and ""backend.""

Given that the user has shown significant interest in these other keywords but has not searched for anything related to ""contact"" or ""backend,"" it seems that the user is likely not interested in this new announcement.

1616,"Based on the given information, the user's search history shows that they have frequently searched for the tag ""competition"" a total of 50 times. The new announcement contains the keywords ""participants,"" ""planning,"" and ""competition."" 

Since the user has a strong interest in the tag ""competition,"" having searched it 50 times, it indicates that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement as it directly relates to their previous searches. Although there is no information on the other two tags, the significant interest in ""competition"" suggests that the user is engaged with the topic of the new announcement.

Since the user has frequently searched for ""supporters"" a total of 19 times, this suggests a strong interest in this area, aligning with one of the new announcement's keywords. However, the other keywords in the new announcement, namely ""event,"" do not appear in the user's search history, indicating that the user's interest in these specific terms is unclear.

Considering the substantial interest in ""supporters,"" it is likely that the user may have some level of interest in the new announcement. However, the lack of searches related to the other two keywords keeps this assessment somewhat ambiguous. Therefore, the predicted interest level can be interpreted as a 1 for the user's potential interest due to the high frequency of searches related to ""supporters.""",1

The user has searched for ""education"" and ""lecture"" multiple times, both of which are included in the new announcement's keywords. This suggests that the user may have a significant interest in related topics. However, the presence of other keywords such as ""club,"" ""seminar,"" ""meeting,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""volunteering,"" which have not been searched by the user, makes it somewhat uncertain whether the user will find the announcement entirely relevant.

Nonetheless, the high frequency of searches for ""education"" (18 times) and ""lecture"" (11 times) indicates the user likely has a positive inclination (1) towards the new announcement due to the overlap with their interests.",1

These significant search frequencies for ""Education,"" ""Lecture,"" and ""Mentoring"" suggest that the user has a strong interest in these topics. Since these keywords match the new announcement's keywords, it implies that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

Given that the user has not searched for ""Image"" at all, this aspect of the announcement might be less relevant to them. However, the overall correlation between the user's search history and the keywords of the new announcement supports the conclusion that they are interested in the content.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the ""education"" tag, evidenced by the 23 searches, it indicates a strong likelihood that they would be interested in the new notice containing ""education."" The user’s searches for ""lecture"" could also suggest a related interest in events, particularly since lectures are often associated with educational events. 

However, since the user hasn't demonstrated any direct interest in ""event"" as a specific tag (as none have been searched recently), this might introduce some ambiguity regarding their interest in the new notice as a whole.

Instead, the user's recent searches predominantly focus on topics related to ""Training Grants,"" ""Employment Support,"" ""Backend Development,"" and other job-related subjects.

The user has a notable interest in design, but they have also searched for planning and contest multiple times, indicating a positive inclination towards these areas. Since the new announcement contains the keywords ""planning"" and ""contest,"" which the user has searched in the past, it suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

Specifically, they have searched for keywords related to their career development, job placements, and various training courses multiple times. 

Given this context, the absence of any interactions with the keywords from the new announcement suggests that the user does not find the new information relevant to their interests. The user's persistent focus on employment and training topics, along with the lack of engagement with educational programs or the upcoming academic year, reinforces the conclusion that they are unlikely to be interested in the new announcement.",0

The user has searched the following keywords: Big Data (2 times), Python (1 time), and Backend (2 times), among a variety of others. Although there is some engagement with the keywords 'Big Data' and 'Backend', the frequency of searches for these keywords is relatively low compared to other keywords like AI (6 times) and supporter-related keywords (4 times each). 

Particularly, the absence of searches related to important keywords in the new announcement, such as Java, government-funded support, and Frontend, suggests that the user may not feel a strong connection or relevance to the content of the new announcement.

Although ""employment"" is a variation of ""job,"" the user's search history reflects a related interest in job opportunities overall. The presence of ""AI"" in the new announcement does not appear in the user's search history, making it less relevant for determining interest.

While ""curriculum"" overlaps with the new announcement's keywords, it is not sufficient to demonstrate a strong interest in the other areas presented in the new announcement.

Given that the user has focused their searches on technical skills and career-related topics rather than on educational contests or announcements, it seems they might not have an interest in the new announcement.

The user's search history does not include any of the keywords from the new announcement—specifically, there are no searches related to ""submission method"" or ""UCC.""

In contrast, the user's recent search history shows the keyword tags: ""Event"" (7 times), ""Meeting"" (8 times), ""Club"" (8 times), ""Event"" (7 times), and ""Volunteer"" (6 times).

Considering the user has searched for ""Event"" multiple times (7 times), which is relevant to the new announcement, it suggests that the user may have some interest in events and related activities. However, the user's search history does not show a direct interest in the other specific keywords listed in the new announcement, such as ""Job Consulting"" and ""Job Support.""

The presence of multiple tags indicating interest in related activities suggests a moderate level of interest. However, since it is not as clear cut as having more direct searches for the keywords in the new announcement, one could conclude that the user is somewhat interested (1) in the newly announced information, but with some ambiguity due to the lack of clear searches aligning with all key areas.

This lack of relevant keywords in the new announcement suggests that it may not align with the user's previously expressed interests.

While the user has actively searched for events and initiatives related to meetings and volunteering, the absence of key information in the new announcement makes it difficult to determine whether the user would be interested in it.

1657,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows a high interest in ""planning"" with 33 searches, as well as a notable interest in ""contest"" with 17 searches. The new notice contains keywords such as ""student participation,"" ""contest,"" and ""educational program."" 

Considering the user's previous searches, the tag ""contest"" aligns perfectly with the new notice's keywords. The fact that the user has searched for ""contest"" significantly (17 times) suggests a clear interest in this topic. Additionally, while ""student participation"" and ""educational program"" were not searched for in the user's history, the strong interest in the related ""contest"" tag indicates a potential inclination towards events that may involve student participation, especially if they are contests.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the user is likely interested in this new notice, leading to the conclusion of a score of 1 for the target rating.",1
1658,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes the keywords ""planning"" and ""poster."" The user's search history shows significant interest in these topics, particularly with ""planning"" searched 18 times and ""poster"" searched 8 times. Given that the user has actively searched for related keywords that align with the new announcement, it suggests a clear interest. Therefore, the probability that the user is engaged with the new announcement is high, and we classify the target score as 1, indicating interest.",1
1659,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for the following tags: ""course registration"" 9 times, ""AI"" 8 times, ""education"" 7 times, ""K-Digital"" 7 times, ""lecture"" 7 times, ""COVID-19"" 6 times, and ""mentoring"" 6 times. The new announcement's keywords include ""education,"" ""employment,"" and ""internship.""

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""education"" (7 times), this suggests a level of interest in educational content. However, there are no searches related to ""employment"" or ""internship,"" which may indicate a lack of interest in those specific areas. Thus, while the user's interest in ""education"" aligns with one of the new announcement's keywords, the overall absence of interest in the other two keywords leads to ambiguity regarding the user's level of interest in the announcement as a whole.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems the user may have some interest (1) due to their searches in ""education,"" but the absence of searches in ""employment"" and ""internship"" creates uncertainty regarding their overall engagement with the new announcement.",0
1660,"Based on the given information, the target score is 0, which indicates that the user is not interested in the new announcement. The keyword tags for the new announcement are ""lecture,"" ""curriculum,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""education."" 

However, the user's search history shows significant interest in different keywords: ""student support"" (18 times), ""contest"" (17 times), and ""planning"" (15 times). The absence of any searches related to the new announcement's keywords suggests a lack of interest in these topics. 

Given that the user has focused extensively on other themes while completely disregarding the new announcement's key areas, it's reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to find the new announcement relevant or engaging. Therefore, the information indicates that the user does not have an interest in the new announcement.",0
1661,"Based on the given information, the user has a ""goal score"" of 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new notice. The keyword information for the new notice lacks significant tags, which may suggest a lack of relevance or appeal to the user. The user's search history shows they have searched for ""graduate students"" 21 times, ""scholarships"" 17 times, and ""undergraduate students"" 12 times. 

Despite the frequent searches in their history, the absence of targeted keywords in the new notice implies that the notice does not align with the user's interests. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is not inclined toward the new announcement, as it does not contain topics they have previously engaged with or shown interest in.",0

Given that the user's search history does not include any searches related to the new keywords, it suggests that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the absence of relevant searches indicates a lack of interest in the new announcement, supporting the goal score of 0.",0
1663,"Based on the given information, the target score indicates that the user is not interested in the new announcement (0). The new announcement includes keywords such as ""Server,"" ""Cloud,"" and ""K-Digital.""

The absence of any searches related to the keywords provided for the new announcement suggests a lack of interest in this particular topic. Although the user has been actively seeking out information related to scholarships and employment opportunities, the new announcement's keywords do not align with their recent search behavior, indicating a disconnect in interest. Therefore, it can be concluded that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement based on their prior search patterns.",0
1664,"Based on the given information, the user's ""notification search history"" reveals several keywords such as Education (12 times), Event (7 times), AI (6 times), Activity (5 times), Employment (4 times), Employment Support (4 times), Educational Course (4 times), Mentoring (3 times), Supporters (3 times), and Festival (2 times). However, the new notification's keyword information lacks significant keywords. This absence of key terms makes it ambiguous whether the user will show interest in the notification or not.

Given that the user has frequently searched for various relevant topics, one might speculate that they are indeed interested in notifications related to these themes. Yet, the lack of specific important keywords in the new notification suggests that it may not strongly resonate with the user's identified interests. Therefore, despite the user's past search behavior indicating a potential inclination towards notifications, the current notification's vague and non-specific content likely fails to excite interest.

Consequently, the ""target rating"" of 0 indicates that the user is not inclined to engage with the new notification.",0
1665,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new notice. The user's search history includes 13 times for ""Job Support,"" 10 times for ""Design,"" 10 times for ""AI,"" 10 times for ""Web Publisher,"" and 7 times for ""Education."" However, the new notice's keywords are ""Competition"" and ""UCC,"" which do not match any of the keywords the user has previously searched. 

This suggests that the user has not shown any interest in the topics related to the new notice, as their previous searches are focused on entirely different subjects. Therefore, it can be concluded that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new notice associated with competition and UCC, as there is no overlap between the searched keywords and the new keywords.",0

The user has searched for ""competition"" 13 times, ""essay"" 11 times, ""game"" 10 times, ""supporters"" 7 times, ""planning"" 5 times, and ""poster"" 4 times. 

The new announcement features the keywords ""planning"" and ""competition."" Although the user has only searched for ""planning"" 5 times, the overwhelmingly high interest in ""competition"" (13 searches) suggests a significant relevance to the new announcement. This may imply that the user is indeed interested in the new announcement due to their strong history of searching for related content in ""competition.""

Therefore, considering the keywords and the user's search history, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to have an interest in the new announcement, hence the target rating of 1.",1

Given that these tags are present in both the notice and the user's search history, it strongly suggests that the user has a genuine interest in the subjects covered by this new notice. The high frequency of searches related to these specific keywords supports the conclusion that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the evidence indicates that the user is interested in the notice.",1
1668,"Based on the given information, the user's search record shows that they have looked up the following keywords: 14 times for 'planning', 9 times for 'education', 5 times for 'lecture', and 6 times for 'mentoring'. The new notice has the keywords 'education', 'lecture', and 'mentoring'.

Given that 'education' aligns directly with the user's previous searches (9 times), 'lecture' reflects a smaller interest (5 times), and 'mentoring' has also been searched (6 times), it suggests that the user likely has a significant interest in the topics presented in the new notice. The frequency of searches for related key terms indicates that the user is engaged with these subjects.

Therefore, since the user has demonstrated strong interest in relevant keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that they have an interest in the new notice, which aligns with the provided target score of '1'.",1

The user has shown a strong engagement with these keywords, particularly with Government Support and Backend, both searched 5 times. Furthermore, the user has also searched Frontend Development and Frontend 4 times each, indicating an interest in these areas as well.

The new notice contains keywords: ""contact information,"" ""lecture,"" ""free education,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" and ""recruitment of trainees."" Among these, the user has searched ""education"" a significant 9 times and ""mentoring"" 5 times. This indicates a strong interest in educational offerings and mentoring opportunities.

Given that the user has frequently searched for both ""education"" and ""mentoring,"" it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to have an interest in the new notice, which aligns well with their previous search history.

However, the new announcement's keywords are ""student participation"" and ""university job center,"" which do not directly match any of the user's previous searches.

Given that the user has searched for ""education"" 10 times and ""lecture"" 6 times, which match the new announcement's keywords, there is strong evidence that the user has a genuine interest in the mentioned topics. Additionally, the user has searched for ""mentoring"" once, directly corresponding to another keyword in the announcement.

Since the user has not searched for any keywords that directly match those in the new announcement, it is evident that there is a lack of direct interest.

However, the new notice does not contain any significant keywords, suggesting that it may be too specific or irrelevant to the user's interests.

Considering the user's search history, they have repeatedly searched for various topics related to support, application processes, and credit exchange. Since the new notice lacks any meaningful keywords that relate to the user's previous searches, it is logical to conclude that they are unlikely to find any interest in it. The absence of relevant keywords in the new notice aligns with the user's search behavior, reinforcing the low likelihood of interest.",0

This suggests that the user's interests lie in areas connected to ""COVID-19,"" ""Planning,"" and ""Contests,"" which do not align with the new announcement's keywords. The absence of any related searches for ""Participation Target"" and ""Employment"" indicates a lack of interest in these topics.

None of these tags pertain to the COVID-19 topic.

The user's extensive search history indicates a clear interest in topics specifically related to graduate studies and scholarships, rather than events or UCC content. Given this lack of relevance between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords, it appears that the user is likely not interested in the new announcement.

While the user has searched for ""멘토링"" and ""교육,"" which are also present in the announcement, the absence of searches for ""강연,"" ""콘텐츠 제작,"" and ""신청 방법"" indicates a lack of engagement with these specific concepts.

Considering the user's previous search behaviors, the higher frequency of searching ""employment"" indicates a stronger likelihood that they may be interested in the new announcement.

The user's search history reveals that they have searched for ""course registration"" 18 times, ""image"" 13 times, ""precautions"" 10 times, and ""security"" 9 times. 

Given that ""course registration"" aligns with one of the key topics in the new notice, it suggests a strong interest in this specific area. The high frequency of searching for this tag indicates that the user is likely engaged with the subject matter. 

However, the other tags in the new notice, ""credit recognition"" and ""winter semester,"" do not appear in the user's search history at all. This absence makes it somewhat ambiguous whether the user is interested in these topics.

1699,"Based on the given information, the user's ""announcement search history"" includes multiple instances of the keyword ""student participation,"" which has been searched 50 times. The new announcement contains the keywords ""bootcamp"" and ""curriculum."" 

Given that the user has consistently searched for ""student participation,"" it suggests a strong interest in topics related to engagement and involvement in educational settings. However, neither ""bootcamp"" nor ""curriculum"" directly aligns with the user's recent search history. 

Since there is no evidence in the search history that indicates an interest in ""bootcamp"" or ""curriculum,"" it appears the user is likely not interested in the new announcement. Thus, the target score of 0 suggests that the user does not find this announcement relevant or appealing to their interests at this time.",0
1700,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating that they do not seem to be interested in the new announcement's keywords, which are ""Supporters"" and ""Press Team.""

However, none of these searches coincide with the new announcement's keywords. 

This lack of relevant searches suggests that the user is not engaged with the new announcement's content relating to ""Supporters"" and ""Press Team."" Therefore, the indication is clear that the user likely does not have an interest in this announcement.",0

However, the new announcement's keywords are ""supporters,"" ""recruitment of supporters,"" ""reporter group,"" and ""content production."" 

Since there is no overlap between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords, it suggests that the user is not likely to be interested in this announcement. The absence of related tags in the user's previous searches indicates a lack of relevance, and thus the target rating of 0 appears to be justified.",0
1702,"Based on the given information, the new announcement has a keyword of ""Contest."" The user's search history shows that they searched for ""Student Support"" 18 times, ""Contest"" 17 times, and ""Planning"" 15 times. Given that the user has searched for the ""Contest"" tag 17 times out of their recent 50 searches, it indicates that they have a significant interest in this keyword. Therefore, it seems likely that the user is interested in the new announcement related to the ""Contest,"" which aligns well with the target score of 1.",1

While the user's interest in ""lecture"" and ""mentoring"" aligns well with the keywords of the new announcement, their higher frequency of searching for ""participation target"" may indicate a strong preference for that topic. However, the significant number of searches for ""lecture"" (8 times) and ""mentoring"" (7 times) suggests a potential interest in the new announcement.

Since the user has engaged with both ""lecture"" and ""mentoring,"" even though they have a pronounced interest in other areas, it's reasonable to conclude that they might have some interest in the new announcement. Therefore, the indication points toward a positive outcome (1) regarding the user's interest in the new announcement.",1

In contrast, the new announcement's keywords include educational program, academy, application guidance, lecture, mentoring, and education.

Since the tags from the user's search history do not overlap with the new announcement's keywords at all, this suggests a potential lack of interest in the new notice. The absence of relevant searches indicates that the user has not shown prior interest in educational or mentoring opportunities, which are central to the new announcement. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement, leading to a target score of 0.",0

However, the user's recent search history shows interests primarily in different keywords: ""Education"" was searched 12 times, ""2024 Admission,"" ""Eligibility for Application,"" ""Winter Session,"" and ""Scholarship"" with respective frequencies. 

Although ""Education"" appears in both the new announcement and the user's search history, the other two keywords, ""Employment"" and ""Job Preparation,"" do not match any of the user's recent searches. The high frequency of ""Education"" could suggest a general interest, but without a specific focus on ""Employment"" or ""Job Preparation,"" it indicates that the user may not find this particular announcement compelling. Therefore, the absence of relevant searches related to the remaining keywords leads to a conclusion that the user does not have sufficient interest in the new announcement.",0
1706,"Based on the given information, the user's search history shows a strong interest in several keywords related to the new announcement. The user searched for ""education"" 11 times, ""server"" 8 times, ""intern"" 8 times, ""employment"" 7 times, ""management"" 6 times, ""trade"" 5 times, ""cloud"" 3 times, and ""employment support"" 2 times. 

The new announcement contains keywords such as ""trade,"" ""employment,"" ""government-funded support,"" ""lecture,"" ""curriculum,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" ""entrepreneurship,"" and ""intern."" Among these, ""trade"" (5 times), ""employment"" (7 times), and ""education"" (11 times) directly match the user's past searches. 

Given that the user has shown repeated interest in ""trade"" and ""employment,"" it leans towards indicating that there is likely genuine interest in the new announcement. The keyword frequency suggests that the user is not only aware of these topics but values them enough to search repeatedly. Therefore, the user's target score of 1 reflects a positive assessment of interest in the new announcement.",1
1707,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords ""employment"", ""competition"", and ""internship"". The user's recent search history indicates they have searched for the tag ""competition"" 50 times. This overwhelming focus on the ""competition"" keyword suggests that the user has a strong interest in this topic. Given that one of the new announcement's keywords is ""competition"", it is logical to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in the announcement, hence the target score of 1.",1

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the ""Education"" tag, which directly correlates with one of the keywords in the new notice, it indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the new notice. The lack of searches related to ""Ministry of Employment and Labor"" or ""Employment"" makes the interest slightly less certain but does not negate the strong interest shown in ""Education.""

Thus, the user appears to have a positive inclination towards the new notice and the goal score of 1 (interested) is justified.",1

The new notice contains keywords such as ""Cybersecurity,"" ""Education Program,"" ""Employment Connection,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" ""Education,"" and ""Recruitment of Trainees."" Notably, this user's history includes frequent searches on ""Lecture,"" ""Security,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Education,"" which align closely with some of the keywords in the new notice.

In particular, the user has searched for ""Education"" extensively, indicating a strong interest in educational opportunities. The presence of ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring"" in both the new notice and the user's search history further suggests an interest in the upcoming notice. This, combined with the user's specific searches connected to ""Employment,"" also aligns with the keywords found in the new notice.

Thus, given the overlap in interests represented in the user's search history and the keywords associated with the new notice, it is logical to deduce that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement. Therefore, the target score of 1 seems justified.",1
1710,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""education"" and ""employment."" The user's search history reveals that they have shown interest in various related topics, having searched ""education"" 10 times and ""employment"" 9 times.

1711,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains keywords ""meeting"" and ""volunteer."" The user's search history shows that they have searched for ""meeting"" 9 times and ""volunteer"" 7 times.

Since the user has shown a significant interest in the ""Contest"" tag, with a total of 16 searches, this suggests a strong likelihood that they would be interested in the new announcement, which includes the ""Contest"" keyword. Even though there are no direct searches for ""Planning"" or ""Essay,"" the high frequency of searches related to ""Contest"" indicates that the user may indeed find the new announcement relevant and intriguing.

Therefore, the logical conclusion, with respect to the target score of 1 (indicating interest), suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.",1
1713,"Based on the given information, the user has a history of searching for the keywords ""Meeting"" (28 times) and ""Supporter"" (22 times). The new notice contains the keywords ""Supporter"" and ""Reporter."" 

Since the user has shown significant interest in the keyword ""Supporter"" by searching it 22 times, it suggests that they may be interested in the new notice, especially as it includes a related keyword. However, there are no searches related to the keyword ""Reporter."" 

Overall, since the user has engaged with a relevant keyword and demonstrated interest in it previously, we can conclude they are likely interested in the new notice. Therefore, the likelihood of the target score being 1 is high, with some ambiguity regarding the keyword ""Reporter.""",1

The user has not consistently searched for all of these keywords but does show a notable interest in ""government support,"" ""employment,"" ""mentoring,"" ""curriculum,"" and ""education,"" with the highest frequency being ""education"" with 8 searches. Given this pattern, it appears that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, especially since many of the keywords match their past searches.

Since the user has searched for ""Contest"" 10 times and ""Application Period"" 10 times, it indicates a clear interest in both of these topics. Given that the user has engaged with these keywords frequently, it suggests that they likely have a positive interest in the new announcement that includes these keywords.

However, the new announcement's keyword is ""planning,"" which does not directly align with any of the previously searched tags.

On the other hand, the keyword ""image"" does not appear in the user's search history at all, which suggests that the user may not have any interest in that particular topic.

Considering the combined interests shown in the relevant tags alongside the absence of searches for ""image,"" we can logically conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, thus assigning a target score of 1 for user interest.",1

Since none of the keywords from the new announcement overlap with the user's previous search interests, it suggests that the user may not find the new announcement relevant to their interests. The total absence of related searches for ""Participants,"" ""Awards,"" and ""Planning"" from the history indicates that the user is unlikely to be interested in this announcement.

Notably, the user has searched for ""mentoring"" and ""lecture"" a combined total of 14 times, which suggests a clear interest in these areas. Furthermore, the user has shown interest in ""education"" 6 times, which aligns with the announcement's focus.

Since the new announcement contains the keywords ""planning"" and ""competition,"" the user's interest in planning is evident, but the lack of searches related to ""competition"" makes it unclear whether they would be interested in this specific announcement overall.

Therefore, since only one of the two keywords from the new announcement aligns with the user's previous searches, the likelihood of the user being interested in the new announcement appears low. This aligns with the target score of 0.",0

Since the user has not searched for any of the relevant keywords associated with the new announcement, it suggests that the user likely does not have an interest in this particular announcement. Therefore, the ""target score"" of 0 indicates a lack of interest.",0

Given the new announcement includes the keywords ""lecture"", ""free education"", ""mentoring"", and ""education"", it is clear that there is a significant alignment between the user's interests and the new announcement. 

The high frequency of searches for ""education"" suggests a strong overall interest in educational content. Moreover, searching ""lecture"" 18 times and ""free education"" 9 times shows a distinct focus on those particular areas of the content in the new announcement. 

Therefore, it can be logically inferred that the user is likely interested in the new announcement since they have actively searched for keywords that are present in it. Based on this analysis, the target score for the user's interest in the announcement would be 1.",1

The lack of direct searches for tags like ""government funding,"" ""free education,"" ""IT education,"" ""game,"" ""portfolio,"" and ""programming"" suggests that the user may not have a strong interest in those specific areas.

The new announcement contains relevant keywords such as ""교육"" (education), ""취업 지원"" (employment support), and ""강연"" (lecture).  

The consistent interest in ""교육"" and ""취업"" suggests that the user is likely engaged with announcements that contain related content. Although they have not searched for ""교육 프로그램"" (educational program), ""무료 교육"" (free education), or ""AI 교육"" (AI education) specifically, their notable interest in ""교육"" shows a broader interest in educational opportunities.

Since there are no searches related to ""credit exchange"" or ""current students"" in their recent history, it appears that the user is not interested in the new announcement.

1738,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""scholarship"" and ""university student."" The user's search history indicates that they searched for ""scholarship"" 9 times and ""university student"" 7 times. Given that both keywords are highly represented in the user's search records, this suggests a strong interest in the topics related to scholarships and university students. Therefore, it is likely that the user is interested in the new announcement, leading to the score of 1 for the target rating.",1
1739,"Based on the given information, the user has a ""목표평점"" of 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement.

However, none of these keywords are related to the new announcement's keyword, which is ""student support."" The absence of any searches relevant to ""student support"" suggests that the user may not find this announcement appealing or relevant to their needs, as they have not demonstrated interest in this area in their past searches. This lack of connection between the user's search history and the new announcement's keyword supports the conclusion that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new announcement.",0
1740,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a total of 6 searches related to the keyword ""Supporters"" (서포터즈) in their recent search history while the new notice's keyword is also ""Supporters."" This significant interest, indicated by multiple searches for the same keyword, suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the notice, leading us to conclude a target score of 1 (indicating interest). The consistent engagement with the ""Supporters"" tag in their search history affirms their relevance to the new announcement.",0
1741,"Based on the given information, the new notice has keywords related to ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""education."" The user's search history indicates a strong interest in ""education,"" having searched for it 12 times, which significantly aligns with the new notice. Additionally, the user searched for ""lecture"" 7 times, showing another area of interest that correlates with the new notice. However, there is no mention of ""mentoring"" in the user's search history, which leaves some ambiguity regarding this specific keyword. 

Given the high frequency of searches for ""education"" and reasonably frequent searches for ""lecture,"" it suggests that the user is likely interested in the new notice which contains relevant topics. Therefore, it can be inferred that the user's score indicating interest in the new notice is 1.",1

However, the keyword of the new announcement is ""eligibility requirements."" 

Since none of the user's recorded searches pertain to ""eligibility requirements,"" it can be inferred that the user does not find this announcement relevant or interesting to their previous interests. The absence of any related searches suggests that the user is unlikely to engage with this new information, corroborating the goal rating of 0.",0
1743,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new announcement. The tags for the new announcement include ""Online Education,"" ""Scholarship,"" and ""Mentoring."" 

Examining the user's search history, we see searches for various tags, such as ""Employment"" (8 times), ""Education"" (6 times), ""Exhibition"" (4 times), and ""Mentoring"" (2 times). While the user has shown some interest in education and mentoring, the dominant focus appears to be on employment-related topics. 

Furthermore, the specific tag ""Online Education,"" which is one of the new announcement's keywords, does not align directly with the user's previous searches, as they did not search for this particular term. Although there is some interest in ""Mentoring,"" it is not as pronounced compared to their interest in employment. 

Therefore, the combination of the user's predominant searches leaning towards employment and the lack of specific interest in the new announcement's keywords suggests that this user is likely not interested in the new announcement, supporting a score of 0.",0

Specifically, the user has searched for ""공모전"" 18 times, which indicates a strong interest in contest-related content. Additionally, the user has searched for ""UCC"" 5 times, suggesting some level of interest in user-created content as well.

The new announcement features keywords related to ""공모전"" (Contest), ""참가자격"" (Eligibility), and ""UCC"" (User Created Content). The user's extensive search history for ""공모전"" implies that the user is likely keen on participating or obtaining information related to contests, thus making the new announcement relevant to their interests. Although there isn't any historical search data for ""참가자격,"" the presence of both ""공모전"" and ""UCC"" in the new announcement aligns with the user's search behavior.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in the new announcement, supporting a positive rating of 1 for the target score.",1
1745,"Based on the given information, the user has a ""goal score"" of 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new notice.

Specifically, the user searched for ""contract"" 11 times, ""job announcement"" 8 times, and ""application period"" 7 times, among others. However, the new notice's keywords are ""planning"" and ""participant qualification."" These keywords do not match any keywords the user has shown interest in through their search history. 

Given that there is no overlap between the user's search activity and the notice's keywords, it suggests that the user is unlikely to have an interest in the new notice. Therefore, the absence of relevant search queries related to ""planning"" and ""participant qualification"" logically supports the conclusion that the user does not find the new notice appealing, leading to the goal score of 0.",0

The new notice has keywords ""competition"" and ""participant qualification."" 

Given that the user has shown a strong interest in ""competition"" with 18 searches, it indicates a high likelihood that they would be interested in the new notice. The keyword ""participant qualification,"" however, does not appear in the user's previous searches, making it less clear if they have any specific interest in that aspect. 

Overall, considering the strong interest in ""competition"" and the presence of that keyword in the new notice, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice, resulting in a target score of 1.",1
1747,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains keywords: ""Recruitment Notice,"" ""Qualifications,"" and ""Application Method."" The user's search history shows a significant interest in related topics with 11 searches for ""Qualifications,"" 8 searches for ""Application Method,"" 6 searches for ""Recruitment,"" and 6 searches for ""Notice,"" among others. 

Given that the user has searched for ""Qualifications"" 11 times and ""Application Method"" 8 times, there is strong evidence that the user shows a continuous interest in these key areas. The presence of the ""Recruitment"" keyword, which aligns directly with the ""Recruitment Notice"" in the new announcement, further supports the idea that the user is engaged with this type of content.

Therefore, since the user's search history closely relates to the keywords in the new announcement and indicates a clear interest, it can be logically inferred that the user is likely to be interested in this new notice, supporting a rating of 1 for the target score.",1

Since the user's search history does not include any of the keywords from the new announcement, it suggests that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement. The absence of relevant search terms leads to the conclusion that the user has no apparent interest in the new announcement, which aligns with the target score of 0.",0
1749,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Bootcamp"" and ""AI."" In the user's recent search history, we can observe that they have searched for the keyword ""AI"" 3 times. However, there are no searches for ""Bootcamp"" which means the user has not shown any interest in that specific topic.

Since the user shows some interest in the keyword ""AI,"" albeit limited, it suggests a slight inclination toward topics related to AI. Nonetheless, due to the absence of searches related to ""Bootcamp,"" it is difficult to conclude that the user has a strong interest in the new announcement overall. 

Given that the interest is only partial, this leads to a determination that the user does not have a complete interest in the new announcement. Therefore, the predicted target score is 0.",0
1750,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""Contest"" and ""UCC,"" while the user's notice search history shows that they have searched for the tag ""Contest"" 50 times. This significant frequency of searching for the ""Contest"" tag indicates a strong interest in this area. Given that the target score is 1, it suggests that the user is likely interested in the new notice as it aligns with their previous search behavior. The absence of searches related to ""UCC"" is negligible in this context, as the dominant interest seems to be in ""Contest."" Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in the new notice.",1
1751,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords: Lecture, Free Education, Frontend Development, Mentoring, Education, and Programming Education.

Considering the user has searched for ""Lecture"" 5 times and ""Mentoring"" 4 times, which are part of the new announcement's keywords, it indicates a certain level of interest in these topics. Additionally, the high frequency of searches related to ""Education"" (10 times) directly aligns with the keyword ""Education"" in the new announcement.

Given that the user has shown significant interest in the keyword ""education"" with the highest frequency of searches, along with some interest in the keyword ""lecture,"" it suggests that they might indeed have an interest in the new notice. Although the ""application method"" keyword has not been searched at all, the emphasis on ""education"" and ""lecture"" indicates a positive inclination towards the topics covered in the notice. Therefore, it seems likely that the user is interested in this notice, aligning with the target score of 1.",1

The user has searched for the tags ""Marketing"" 7 times, ""Planning"" 5 times, ""Meetings"" 5 times, and additional tags related to events and activities, but there is no indication of looking for anything associated with student recruitment. This discrepancy suggests that the user is likely more focused on event-based or career-oriented opportunities rather than student recruitment at this time.

Since the primary keyword of the new notice is not directly represented in the user's search history, it suggests that the user might be less likely to be interested in this new notice overall.

The new notice contains keywords related to ""employment,"" ""education,"" ""education program,"" ""youth program,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" ""entrepreneurship,"" and ""internship."" Given that the user has frequently searched for both ""education"" and ""lecture,"" it seems likely that they would be interested in the new notice, especially considering the presence of multiple correlated keywords, particularly ""education"" and ""lecture.”

Therefore, since the user has shown significant activity in related areas, this indicates a positive interest in the new notice, aligning with the target score of 1.",1

In addition, while there are no explicit searches related to employment consulting or employment, the focus on education might imply a broader interest in topics related to employment and career development.

Looking at the tags of the new announcement, which include ""education program,"" ""academy,"" ""application guide,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""education,"" we can analyze the user's interest. The user has searched for the ""education program"" tag 3 times, the ""lecture"" tag 7 times, and the ""mentoring"" tag 7 times, which suggests a strong interest in these areas.

The ""education program"" and ""lecture"" tags correlate with the new announcement's keywords, indicating that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement.

The new notice has the keyword ""AI.""

Since the user has searched for the ""AI"" tag 6 times within their last 50 notice search records, it indicates a notable level of interest in content related to AI.

Although ""education"" is related to the user's search record of ""online education"" (7 times) and ""application guide"" (6 times), the keyword ""supporters"" does not appear in the user's search history at all. This suggests that the user might have an interest in educational content but potentially lacks interest in the ""supporters"" aspect. 

The majority of the user's search history reflects a strong focus on educational topics, which indicates a greater likelihood of interest in the new notice. Therefore, based on the user's consistent engagement with related keywords, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user might be interested in the new notice, even though the absence of interest in the keyword ""supporters"" introduces some ambiguity.

Given that ""contest"" is one of the key themes of the new announcement and is highly represented in the user's search history, it suggests that the user is likely interested in this announcement. The significant frequency of searches related to contests indicates that this user actively seeks out information related to such topics.

However, since the search frequency is relatively low—only 2 and 3 times for the respective tags—it remains somewhat ambiguous whether the user is genuinely interested in these topics or just searching them out of curiosity.

The lack of overlap between the user's search history and the keywords of the new announcement suggests that the user is not interested in this particular information.

From the search history, we can see a strong interest in both ""education"" and ""lecture,"" as these tags have been searched a significant number of times. This indicates that the user is likely interested in topics related to those keywords.

Given that the new announcement includes ""lecture"" and ""education,"" both of which the user has shown considerable interest in, it supports the idea that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement.

The new announcement contains the following keywords: big data, backend, education, government-funded training, AI, employment support, frontend, and non-major education. 

Despite the user's varied searches, they have shown a significant interest in the tag ""education,"" which aligns with the new announcement's keyword ""education.""

However, the remaining keywords such as big data, backend, government-funded training, frontend, and non-major education do not appear in the user's search history, which makes it difficult to definitively conclude that the user has a strong interest in the new announcement as a whole. 

Therefore, while there are indications of interest based on the common tags, the lack of sufficient searches for the other relevant keywords means that the overall interest level is somewhat uncertain. Thus, it may lean towards a score of 1 for interest based on the recurring mentions of ""education"" and ""AI,"" but it's still not entirely certain due to the absence of searches for other important keywords.

Since the user has searched for ""education"" 24 times, it indicates a strong interest in this area, suggesting that they might find the new notice relevant and interesting. However, the user has not searched for ""employment"" in their past records, which may imply less interest or awareness in that area.

Comparing this to the new announcement's keywords, which include ""Employment,"" ""Portfolio,"" ""Entrepreneurship,"" ""Employment Support,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" ""Education,"" and ""Internship,"" we can see that there is a notable overlap. The user has shown interests in ""Lecture"" and ""Mentoring,"" both of which are included in the new announcement's keywords.

Additionally, the user has relevant interests in ""Education,"" which is also a keyword in the new announcement. However, the key phrases ""Employment,"" ""Portfolio,"" ""Entrepreneurship,"" and ""Internship"" are not actively represented in the user's prior search history.

Given that the user has shown considerable engagement with related topics but does not have specific searches related to a few of the primary new keywords, the overall indication leans towards the user potentially having a mixed degree of interest. 

In conclusion, while the user is somewhat interested, as reflected by their search behavior with some matching keywords such as ""Lecture,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Education,"" the absence of searches for the main themes of the announcement suggests that their overall interest is not strongly pronounced. Therefore, since the target score is 1, indicating some interest is present, the logical deduction leads to an outcome where the user appears to maintain a cautious interest in this new announcement.",1
1823,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a notable interest in the tags associated with the new notice, specifically ""교육"" (education) and ""강연"" (lecture). The search history indicates that the user has searched for ""교육"" 11 times and ""강연"" 5 times. 

This substantial frequency of searches related to ""교육"" suggests a strong interest in this area, and the additional searches for ""강연"" reinforce the likelihood of their engagement with the content of the new notice. Given that both tags are directly aligned with what the user has been exploring, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. Therefore, this would correspond to a target score of 1, indicating interest.",1
1824,"Based on the given information, the user has shown no interest in the new announcement related to the keyword ""semiconductor."" The user's search history indicates an active search for various education and financial support topics, such as ""scholarship"" (10 times), ""university student"" (7 times), and other related tags, but there are no searches related to ""semiconductor."" As a result, it seems that the user does not have any interest in the new notice, leading to a target score of 0.",0

The new announcement contains the keywords ""event,"" ""education,"" and ""competition.""

Since the user has shown considerable interest in ""education"" (10 times) and a moderate interest in ""event"" (6 times), it indicates that the user is likely engaged with topics relevant to these keywords. However, there is no indication of interest in ""competition"" as it does not appear in the user's search history. Therefore, it can be inferred that the user is likely interested (1) in the new announcement due to their strong interest in ""event"" and ""education.""",1
1826,"Based on the given information, the target score is 0, indicating that the user is not interested in the new announcement. The keyword information for the new announcement includes ""Qualifications,"" which does not match any of the user's previously searched tags. 

The user's search history shows that they frequently searched for tags related to ""Recruitment Announcement"" (14 times), ""Current Students"" (13 times), ""Student Support"" (12 times), and ""International Exchange"" (11 times). However, none of these tags are relevant to ""Qualifications."" 

This suggests that the user's interests lie significantly outside the context of the new announcement. The absence of related searches indicates a lack of interest in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion that the user is unlikely to engage with it.",0

Specifically, the user searched for the keyword 'contest' 18 times and 'planning' 8 times, which indicates a strong inclination towards these topics. 

Given that the new announcement contains the keywords 'planning' and 'contest', it is reasonable to conclude that the user may indeed be interested in this announcement as their search behavior highlights a significant engagement with these particular tags. This aligns well with the target score of 1, suggesting that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.",1
1828,"Based on the given information, the user has searched the tags ""contest"" 18 times, ""planning"" 8 times, ""poster"" 8 times, ""video"" 6 times, ""submission method"" 5 times, and ""UCC"" 5 times. However, the new announcement's keywords are ""contest,"" ""submission period,"" and ""design.""

Since the user has shown significant interest in the tag ""contest"" with 18 searches, it indicates a strong likelihood of engagement with announcements related to contests. However, the other keywords—""submission period"" and ""design""—were not found in the user's search history, which suggests that there may not be a direct interest in these aspects. 

Overall, the high number of searches for ""contest"" strongly suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, even though the other keywords may not be as relevant. Thus, the model may conclude that the user is interested in the announcement (1).",1
1829,"Based on the given information, the new notice keywords are ""education"" and ""youth."" The user's notice search history shows that they have searched for ""education"" 6 times and ""youth"" 3 times, indicating a moderate level of interest. While the user has not extensively searched for either keyword, the presence of both keywords in their search history suggests that they have at least some interest in topics related to education and youth. 

However, the overall interest level might still be considered low since they have not frequently searched for these specific tags compared to others like ""employment"" and ""internship."" Therefore, it reflects a nuanced interest, suggesting they may find relevance in the new notice but could also be considered indecisive. Given the target score is 0, it seems that the user may not be significantly engaged with this particular notice despite the keywords aligning with their previous searches.",0
1830,"Based on the given information, the user's goal score is 0, indicating that they are not interested in the new announcement. The new announcement has keyword tags related to ""education,"" ""supporters,"" and ""mentoring.""

Although ""mentoring"" is one of the keywords in the new announcement and was searched a few times, the overall pattern of the user's interest suggests a stronger inclination towards other areas, particularly education and employment-related topics. The absence of any searches directly related to ""supporters"" further intensifies the disconnect regarding their interest in this specific announcement.

Therefore, despite the presence of ""mentoring"" in both the new announcement and the user's search history, the dominant preference for other themes, coupled with the lack of direct relevance to the announcement, provides a logical basis for concluding that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement, resulting in a score of 0.",0

The new notice contains the keywords ""education"" and ""employment."" The user appears to have a strong interest in both topics, as they have searched for ""education"" significantly more than any other keyword.

There are significant overlaps between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords. Particularly, the user has shown interest in ""education"" (11 times) and ""lecture"" (5 times), both of which are present in the new announcement. Additionally, the user's interest in ""youth"" (5 times) aligns with the ""youth program"" keyword. In summary, the user's search behavior suggests that they are likely interested in the new announcement, leading to the conclusion that the target score is 1.",1
1833,"Based on the given information, the user has not shown any interest in the new announcement, as the keyword information for the new announcement reveals that there are no significant keywords present.

However, since the new announcement contains no relevant keywords that align with the user's previous search interest, it seems the user is not inclined to find this announcement appealing. Therefore, the target score is 0, indicating a lack of interest.",0
1834,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates a strong interest in the tags ""visual"" (11 times), ""education"" (10 times), and ""employment"" (9 times). Although the user has not searched for ""job preparation"" at all, their frequent searches for ""education"" and ""employment"" align closely with the new announcement's keywords of ""education"" and ""employment."" 

Given that the user has engaged with the relevant tags ""education"" and ""employment"" multiple times, it suggests a higher likelihood that they are interested in the new announcement. Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement based on their past search behavior, justifying the target score of 1.",1

Since there are no matches between the user's search history and the new announcement keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not interested in this new announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0
1836,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""Youth,"" ""Planning,"" and ""Contest."" The user's search history indicates that they have looked for the following keywords: ""Education"" 24 times, ""Contest"" 15 times, and ""Planning"" 11 times. 

Given these records, we can deduce that the user has shown a notable interest in ""Contest,"" as they searched for this keyword 15 times, which correlates with one of the keywords in the new announcement. Additionally, the user has searched for ""Planning"" 11 times, which is also a keyword in the announcement. However, the keyword ""Youth"" is not present in the user's search history.

Considering the combination of these search records, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. Despite the absence of searches for ""Youth,"" the strong interest in both ""Contest"" and ""Planning"" suggests that the user may indeed find the new announcement relevant. Thus, the final prediction for the interest score, or goal rating, would be 1, indicating the user is likely interested.",1
1837,"Based on the given information, the user's goal rating is 1, indicating that they are interested in the new announcement. The new announcement contains keywords such as Club, Meeting, Youth Program, Lecture, Mentoring, Volunteer, Education, and Career Exploration. Analyzing the user's search history reveals that they have searched for related tags multiple times: 9 times for Volunteer, 6 times for Meeting, and 6 times for Club. 

The frequency of searches for the tags 'Volunteer', 'Meeting', and 'Club' suggests a strong interest in these areas. Given that these keywords overlap significantly with the new announcement's keywords, particularly with 'Club' and 'Meeting', it reinforces the idea that the user is likely to find the upcoming announcement relevant and engaging. Thus, the information supports the conclusion that the user shows interest in the new notice, evident from their past search behavior.",1

The new announcement contains the keywords ""lecture,"" ""free education,"" ""frontend development,"" ""mentoring,"" ""education,"" and ""programming education.""

There is a strong correlation between the new announcement's keywords and the user's search history. Specifically, the keyword ""lecture"" was present in both the new announcement and the user's history, indicating a substantial interest, as the user searched for it 10 times. Additionally, the keyword ""education"" is also reflected in the user's search records, with 6 searches, highlighting a broader interest in educational content.

Although the keywords ""frontend development,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""programming education"" were not directly mentioned in the user's search history, the significant focus on related keywords such as ""education"" and ""lecture"" suggests an overall interest in educational programs. However, the absence of specific queries for ""free education,"" ""frontend development,"" and ""mentoring"" indicates a less direct interest in these specific topics.

Considering this, the user is quite likely to be interested in the new announcement (1), particularly because of their prior searches for ""lecture"" and ""education.""",1

The new announcement has keywords ""기획"" (planning), ""공모전"" (competition), and ""지원방법"" (application method). 

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""공모전"" and ""기획"", it suggests a strong interest in related topics, and the presence of these keywords in the new announcement aligns well with their browsing history. Although ""지원방법"" (application method) has not been directly represented in the user's search history, the high engagement with other keywords from the new announcement indicates a likelihood of interest.

Specifically, the user searched for ""KAU"" 18 times, ""모집"" (recruitment) 17 times, and ""학생 참여"" (student participation) 15 times. Although the new announcement only contains the keyword ""KAU,"" the high frequency of searches for ""KAU"" indicates a strong interest in this topic.

Since the user has not shown any interest in the keywords ""event"" and ""award,"" as these keywords do not align with their recorded searches, it can be concluded that the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement.

Considering that the user has shown significant interest in ""competition"" with 16 searches and has also searched ""education,"" which can be related to the context of competitions, it is reasonable to conclude that the user might be interested in the new announcement regarding the ""competition"" keyword. Additionally, although ""essay"" and ""literature"" are present in the announcement's keywords, they have not been searched by the user and could be considered less relevant to their interests.

Therefore, since there is a strong correlation with the ""competition"" tag and a lesser connection with the other keywords, it appears the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, supporting a target score of 1.",1

Given that the user has searched for both relevant tags a significant number of times, it shows a clear interest in these topics.

The remaining tags in the announcement, such as ""Club,"" ""Meeting,"" ""College Student Participation,"" ""Mentoring,"" and ""Education,"" are either not referenced at all or only mentioned in the context of a broader search (e.g., related to specific training and job support topics).

Additionally, the user has a strong interest in ""education,"" as reflected in their 12 searches for ""education."" This consistent pattern indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement due to the overlap in keywords.

However, since ""lecture"" is a new keyword that the user has not searched for previously, it adds an element of uncertainty. Despite this, the significant interest in ""mentoring"" and ""education"" strongly suggests that the user is interested in the new announcement as it includes relevant topics they've searched for. Therefore, the likelihood of the user being interested in this announcement is high, supporting a target score of 1.",0

However, since the new announcement does not contain any relevant keywords tied to these interests, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in this specific announcement.

Despite the user demonstrating a strong interest in various professional and educational topics, there is no evidence of interest in competitions. Consequently, since the user has not searched for any keywords related to ""Competition,"" it suggests that they are likely not interested in the new announcement.

While the user has some interest in ""design"" and ""AI education,"" the absence of significant searches for terms like ""employment support,"" ""3D,"" and ""video"" suggests that these keywords might not align closely with their interests.

In contrast, the user's recent search history shows a strong focus on various educational and career-related tags, including 12 times on ""Education,"" 7 times on ""Lecture,"" 5 times on ""Press Corps,"" and other tags related to student participation and employment, but none related to Big Data or AI. 

Since the user has not searched for any of the new announcement's keywords and has searched extensively for topics that do not align with the announcement's focus, it reinforces the conclusion that the user is unlikely to be interested in this particular announcement, justifying the goal score of 0.",0

The user's search history shows that they searched for ""scholarship"" 10 times, ""college student"" 7 times, and ""regional criteria"" 3 times. This indicates a strong interest in the relevant topics, as the user has searched for the key terms associated with the new announcement multiple times. 

Given that ""scholarship"" was searched 10 times, this suggests a high level of interest in scholarship opportunities. Additionally, the user’s 7 searches related to ""college student"" further affirm that they are likely engaged with content relevant to their current status as a college student. The 3 searches for ""regional criteria"" also support the notion that the user is considering the context of the new announcement.

Therefore, since the user's search history aligns closely with the keywords of the new notice, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in this announcement, leading to a prediction of a target score of 1.",1

Due to the high frequency of searches for ""AI,"" it is clear that the user has a strong interest in this area. Although ""Big Data"" has been searched less frequently, the overall engagement with related topics combined with the presence of ""Big Data"" in their search history suggests a potential interest.

The significant searches for ""Planning"" and ""Competition"" suggest that the user may find the new announcement relevant and interesting, primarily due to these two keywords that align closely with their previous searches.

1863,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""Education,"" ""Support Method,"" and ""Lecture."" The user's search history indicates a strong interest in these topics, with 11 searches for ""Education,"" 10 searches for ""Lecture,"" and notable searches for ""Participation Target"" and ""Event"" as well.

Since the user has searched for ""Education"" 11 times, it is evident that they have a significant interest in this keyword. Similarly, the user has searched for ""Lecture"" 10 times, further indicating a strong preference for content related to lectures. The absence of searches specifically related to ""Support Method"" might suggest they are less interested in that particular aspect, but the high frequencies of searches for ""Education"" and ""Lecture"" imply that the user is likely interested in the new notice.

Therefore, with both ""Education"" and ""Lecture"" being highly relevant to what the user is likely seeking, it can be concluded that they probably have an interest in the new notice, leading to the target score of 1.",1
1864,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains keywords related to ""scholarship"" and ""mentoring."" The user's search history indicates that they have looked for ""scholarship"" 27 times and ""2024 academic year"" 23 times. While there is a strong interest in ""scholarship,"" the keyword ""mentoring"" has not appeared in the user's search history. 

This suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the notice due to their frequent searches related to scholarships, which align directly with one of the keywords in the new announcement. However, since there is no evidence of interest in ""mentoring,"" the user's overall interest in the new notice may be somewhat limited. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is interested in the notice, leading to a target score of 1.",1
1865,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""scholarship"" and ""university student."" In the user's recent search history, they searched for ""scholarship"" 10 times and ""university student"" 7 times. This suggests a significant level of interest in both keywords, especially considering that the user has searched for ""scholarship"" more than any other tag. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new notice, resulting in a target score of 1.",1
1866,"Based on the given information, the user has searched for tags related to mentoring, university job centers, events, student recruitment, student participation, next-generation communication, and credit exchange. The frequencies of these searches indicate a strong interest in these topics, with the most searched tag being ""mentoring"" at 9 times, followed closely by ""university job centers"" and ""events"" at 8 times each.

However, the new announcement keywords are ""free education"" and ""cloud."" There is no overlap between the user's search history and the new announcement keywords. The absence of any searches related to ""free education"" and ""cloud"" suggests that the user may not be interested in this new announcement.

Thus, considering the lack of relevant search history related to the new keywords, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is not likely to be interested in this announcement, which aligns with the target score of 0.",0
1867,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes keywords ""club,"" ""meeting,"" and ""volunteering."" The user's search history indicates that they have looked for the keyword ""meeting"" 9 times, ""volunteering"" 7 times, and ""club"" 4 times. This shows a significant interest in these topics as the user has actively searched for them multiple times.

Given the user's search records, the frequency of searches for each relevant keyword suggests strong engagement. Specifically, the user searched for ""meeting"" the most at 9 times, indicating a high level of interest. This is followed by ""volunteering"" with 7 searches and ""club"" with 4 searches. 

Since the user has shown consistent interest in all three keywords associated with the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that they are likely to be interested in the new announcement as well. Therefore, the goal rating of 1 seems appropriate in this context.",1
1868,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps."" The user's search history includes the keywords ""Supporters"" searched 8 times and ""Press Corps"" searched 8 times as well. Given that the user has actively searched for both relevant keywords, it indicates a significant interest in these topics. This strong engagement with the keywords associated with the new notice suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the announcement, thereby justifying a target score of 1.",1
1869,"Based on the given information, the user has shown no interest in the new announcement, which is indicated by the goal rating of 0. The keyword information for the new announcement contains no significant keywords, making it unclear whether this announcement would capture the user's attention.

The user's search history shows a significant interest in ""education,"" with this keyword being searched 18 times. Additionally, the user has searched for ""lecture"" 11 times, ""reporter group"" 11 times, and ""supporters"" 10 times. 

Given the prominence of ""education"" in the user's search history, it is reasonable to infer that the user is likely interested in the new announcement. The repeated searches for related keywords indicate that the user has a strong inclination toward topics related to education, suggesting that the user may find the new announcement relevant and appealing. Therefore, the target score is justified as 1, indicating that the user is likely interested in the announcement.",1
1871,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords ""course enrollment"" and ""credit exchange."" The user's search history includes 14 searches for ""credit exchange,"" 7 searches for ""course enrollment,"" and several others. 

The presence of multiple searches for ""credit exchange"" suggests a strong interest in that area. Additionally, while ""course enrollment"" has fewer searches (7 times), it still shows some level of curiosity. 

Given that both keywords from the new announcement appear in the user's search history, it can be inferred that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, supporting a positive score of 1.",1
1872,"Based on the given information, the user's recent search history shows significant interest in several keywords: ""Bootcamp"" with 15 searches, ""Microdegree"" with 7 searches, ""Educational Program"" with 5 searches, ""Next-Generation Communication"" with 5 searches, ""Career Exploration"" with 5 searches, ""Mentor Recruitment"" with 4 searches, ""Korea Aerospace University"" with 3 searches, ""Educational Course"" with 3 searches, and ""Artificial Intelligence"" with 3 searches. However, the new announcement lacks any important keywords. 

Given that there are no relevant keywords in the new announcement, it is understandable why the user might not be interested in it, despite their numerous searches in various areas. This suggests a lack of alignment between the user's interests and the content of the new announcement. Therefore, the model would likely conclude that the user is not interested in the new announcement, leading to a target score of 0.",0
1873,"Based on the given information, the newly released notice includes keywords ""education"" and ""employment."" The user's search history shows that they searched for ""education"" 10 times and ""employment"" 7 times among their recent records. 

This indicates a strong interest in both keywords, especially in ""education,"" as it was searched significantly more than any other category. Given that the user has actively engaged with content related to both ""education"" and ""employment,"" it seems likely that they have a pronounced interest in the new notice, which aligns directly with their search behavior.

The new notice has keywords related to ""Education,"" ""Lecture,"" and ""Mentoring."" The user has searched for the ""Lecture"" tag multiple times, indicating a significant interest in it. Additionally, ""Education"" has been searched 6 times, further demonstrating potential interest in this category. 

While the user has not searched for the ""Mentoring"" keyword, the strong interest in the other two related categories suggests that the user may still be interested in this new notice overall. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the user likely has an interest in the new notice, supporting a score of 1 for the goal rating.",1
1875,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the following keywords: big data, course registration, Java, backend, government support, AI, curriculum, and frontend. The user's search history shows significant interest in keywords such as backend (5 times), AI (2 times), and government support (2 times). 

While the user did not search for the keywords related to big data, course registration, or Java, the keyword ""backend"" is particularly relevant since it was searched 5 times, indicating a strong interest. Furthermore, the user’s previous searches for ""government support"" and ""AI"" also align with the announcement’s keywords. Given this evidence, it suggests that the user has an interest (1) in the new announcement as it contains several topics they have actively sought information about.",1

The new notice keyword is ""Backend."" 

Given that the user has searched for the tag ""Backend"" 4 times, it indicates some level of interest in that topic.

The new announcement has the tags: ""Supporters,"" ""University Student Activities,"" ""Press Corps,"" ""Content Creation,"" and ""Mentoring.""

In this case, the user has searched for the tag ""Supporters"" only once, ""Press Corps"" only once, and ""Mentoring"" twice. However, the user has more frequently interacted with tags related to ""Job Support"" and ""Education."" Given that the user has not shown strong interest or frequency in searching these specific new announcement tags, it suggests that the user is likely to be not interested in the new announcement (goal score: 0). The lack of frequent searches for the relevant keywords indicates a disconnection between the user's past interests and the new announcement.",0

However, the new announcement's keywords are ""Recruitment"" and ""Application Method.""

The user's search history does not include any direct relevance to the keywords of ""Recruitment"" or ""Application Method,"" as none of the recorded searches align with these specific terms.

1880,"Based on the given information, the user has a goal score of 0, indicating a lack of interest in the new notice.

Given the absence of significant keywords in the new notice, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is unlikely to find this notice relevant or interesting, especially when compared to their strong interest in other topics. The user's search behavior reflects a clear focus on areas such as competitions and company explorations, while the new notice does not align with these interests. Thus, the information suggests a clear disinterest, supporting the goal score of 0.",0

This suggests that the user has a notable interest in both of these topics, particularly in ""공모전,"" which they have explored the most among the recent inquiries.

The user's search history does not include any searches for ""planning"" or ""contest,"" which indicates a lack of interest in these specific topics. Although there is a strong interest in related themes like ""volunteer"" and ""meeting,"" it does not translate to a desire for the new notice's content.

The user has searched for the tags ""education"" 8 times and ""employment"" 8 times, which indicates a significant level of interest in these topics. However, the user has not searched for the ""AI"" tag at all. 

Since the user shows considerable engagement with the related tags ""education"" and ""employment"" by searching for them multiple times, it suggests that the user is likely interested in the new notice. The absence of searches for ""AI"" does create some uncertainty, but the higher counts for the other two keywords outweigh this concern.

The user has searched ""design"" and ""video"" multiple times as well, both of which are included in the new notice. However, ""job preparation"" and ""gaming"" were searched only once. This suggests that while there is a clear interest in jobs and education-related topics, the focus on gaming and portfolio might not be as strong.

Overall, considering the higher frequency of searches for ""free education"", ""government support"", ""design"", and ""video"" paired with the keywords from the new notice, it indicates that the user likely has a positive inclination towards the new notice.

Given that the user has actively searched for ""job preparation"" and ""intern,"" which are included in the new announcement, it suggests a strong interest in these areas. In particular, ""job preparation"" is aligned with the user's search history. Additionally, the presence of ""intern"" and ""lecture"" in both the new announcement and the user's previous searches further indicates that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement.

Given that there are no matches between the searched tags and the new notice's keywords, it appears that the user has little to no interest in the new notice.

The user has shown significant interest in the ""education"" tag, but the lack of searches related to the ""visual"" tag leaves uncertainty. 

Since the user's interest is primarily focused on ""education"" and they did not engage with the ""visual"" aspect, it indicates that while there might be some interest in the ""education"" component of the announcement, the absence of alignment with the ""visual"" tag ultimately leads to a conclusion that the user does not find the contents of the new announcement compelling enough to be interested, resulting in a goal score of 0.",0

Given that the user's search history does not include the keyword ""Company Exploration"" or relate to that theme, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely not interested in this specific announcement.

Among these, ""Mentoring"" is common and has been searched multiple times by the user, indicating a possible interest in the new announcement's content related to this tag. The user has also searched various other related educational and career development topics, suggesting an overall inclination towards activities that support professional growth.

However, the presence of other tags such as ""Supporters"" and ""Reporter Group,"" which the user has not searched for, raises some ambiguity. The significant searches for ""Mentoring"" could imply that the user may have some interest in the new announcement, but without the same level of interest in the other tags, it is not certain that the user will be highly engaged with this specific announcement.

Considering these details, there appears to be no direct relevance between the searched tags and the new announcement keywords. The user has shown a strong interest in support and participation roles (e.g., ""supporters"" and ""student participation"") rather than educational topics. This suggests that the user likely does not have an interest in the new announcement regarding trainee recruitment and education, leading to a score of 0 for their interest.",0

However, since there is no direct match for the specific keywords in the user's search history, it is logical to conclude that their interest level is not strong.

Given that the new notice includes the keywords ""planning"" and ""contest,"" and considering the high frequency of searches for these related terms, it is reasonable to conclude that the user likely has a significant interest in the new notice.

Given that the user has not shown any interest in the new notice's keyword and has primarily focused on different aspects of job-related announcements, it's reasonable to conclude that the user is likely not interested in this particular notice, which aligns with the goal score of 0.",0

There are no direct correlations between the keywords of the new announcement and the user's recent search history.

However, the user's search history indicates a strong interest in other topics, such as ""Education"" (10 times), ""Employment"" (7 times), and ""Internship"" (6 times). They have not searched for ""Application Method"" or ""Planning"" at all, which suggests that these keywords do not align with their recent interests.

While there is some overlap with the new announcement's keywords, particularly with ""intern"" and ""employment,"" the majority of the user's search history is focused on different topics that do not directly relate to the announcement. The strong interest in keywords related to ""planning,"" ""supporters,"" and ""design"" suggests a lack of engagement with the topics presented in the new announcement. Therefore, this information leads to the conclusion that the user is likely not interested in the new announcement, as indicated by the goal score of 0.",0

The new announcement contains the keywords ""recruitment"" and ""KAU."" Since none of the user's recent search records correlate with these keywords, it seems that the user has no direct interest in the new announcement. This lack of relevant search history supports the conclusion that the user is not likely to be interested in the announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

Given that the user has frequently searched for both ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps,"" it indicates a strong interest in these specific areas. Since the new notice directly includes the ""Supporters"" and ""Press Corps"" keywords which the user has actively engaged with, we can infer that the user is likely interested in this notice. The significant number of searches for these relevant tags strongly supports the hypothesis that the user will find this new notice appealing. 

Therefore, considering the high frequency of searches related to the new notice's keywords, the target rating can be evaluated as 1.",1

The user shows a strong interest in the ""Contest"" tag, searching for it 17 times, which indicates a clear alignment with the new announcement's keyword information. However, there is no mention of ""UCC"" in the search history, which suggests a lack of interest in that particular area. 

Since ""Contest"" is prominently featured in the user's search pattern and aligns with one of the keywords in the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, thus supporting a target score of 1.",1
1912,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes the keywords ""education"" and ""seminar."" Reviewing the user's recent search history, it shows significant interest in related topics. Specifically, they searched for ""seminar"" 2 times, which indicates some interest in this category. However, they have not searched for ""education"" in their past 50 records. 

With 50 searches, the two searches for ""seminar"" suggest that while the user has some level of curiosity, it may not be strong enough to confirm a definitive interest in the new announcement. The repeated searches for other topics such as ""server,"" ""cloud,"" and ""frontend"" indicate a more focused interest in those areas rather than education or seminars. 

Therefore, it appears that the user's engagement with the relevant keywords is minimal, leading to the conclusion that they are less likely to be interested in the new announcement regarding ""education"" and ""seminar."" Thus, the predicted score indicates a lack of interest.",0

The new notice contains the keywords ""Education"" and ""Competition.""

Since the user has shown a significant interest in ""Competition"" by searching for it 11 times and has also searched for ""Education"" 6 times, it suggests that they are likely to be interested in the new notice. The frequency of these two relevant tags in the user's search history supports the idea that they may find the new notice appealing, indicating a positive interest level, which aligns with the target rating of 1.",1

Given these circumstances, it appears that the user demonstrates a strong interest in several specific areas based on their search history, particularly in ""server,"" ""cloud,"" and ""K-Digital."" Nevertheless, the absence of relevant keywords in the new announcement may lead to uncertainty regarding their interest in that particular notice.

However, the user's search history consists of tags related to educational programs, games, employment support, portfolios, free education, IT education, programming, and government funding, showing a consistent interest in these themes.

None of the tags from the new announcement directly align with the user's previous searches. While ""education"" appears in both the new keywords and the user's past interest, the user has shown a stronger inclination towards specific educational programs and employment-related searches rather than general discussions on education or volunteering-related events.

The new announcement's keywords include ""education,"" ""training programs,"" ""employment support,"" ""lectures,"" ""free education,"" ""AI education,"" and ""mentoring."" 

Given that the user has frequently searched for ""education"" and ""lectures,"" it suggests a strong alignment with the new announcement's keywords. While the user searches primarily for ""education"" 28 times and ""lectures"" 22 times, the overlap with the new announcement's keywords implies that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

However, the user has not searched for the keywords 'application method' or 'employment,' which makes it less clear about their interest in those specific aspects.

Given the strong interest in 'education' and the presence of this keyword in the new announcement, it suggests that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, thus leading to a goal score of 1.",1

While ""Employment"" is one of the keywords in the new announcement and has been searched 8 times, the overall search history mainly reflects interests in ""Education"" and ""Planning."" This indicates that the user may have some interest in the announcement, but it is not strong enough to conclude that they are particularly interested in it, as evidenced by their limited searches for ""Employment"" compared to the other tags.

Therefore, given the user's search history and the absence of strong alignment with the key topics of the new announcement, it can be concluded that the user likely does not have a significant interest in this particular announcement, hence the score of 0.",0

Despite the user showing significant engagement with these tags related to supporters and press activities, none of these tags align with the keyword ""Planning"" from the new announcement. Therefore, it seems that the user's interests are focused on different subjects, suggesting a lack of interest in the current announcement. Consequently, it is logical to infer that the user is not interested in the announcement, leading to the goal score of 0.",0

The presence of ""employment"" and ""internship"" in both the user's search history and the new announcement indicates a strong alignment with the user's interests. Moreover, the user has searched for ""employment support"" and ""lectures"" multiple times, which are also present in the new announcement. 

Overall, since the user has repeatedly searched for relevant keywords that match those in the new announcement, it suggests a high likelihood of interest.

This discrepancy suggests that while the user has a strong interest in educational topics, their search history does not align with the keywords of the new announcement. The absence of relevant searches related to ""University Student Activities"" and ""Student Participation"" implies a lack of interest in the specific content of the new announcement.

Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in the announcement, which aligns with the target score of 0.",0

The new notice's keywords are ""event"" and ""festival."" 

Since none of the user's searches directly correspond to the keywords ""event"" or ""festival,"" it appears that the user does not have an existing interest in these specific topics.

In the 50 search records, the user has searched for ""exhibition"" 5 times, ""festival"" 7 times, and ""event"" is part of the keywords but has not been searched.

Since the user has demonstrated a significant interest in both ""festival"" and ""exhibition,"" coexisting with the related keyword ""event"" in the new notice, it seems likely that they would be interested in the new notice. The absence of searches specifically for ""event"" can be seen as somewhat neutral, but the strong interest in ""festival"" and ""exhibition"" indicates a positive inclination toward the new content.

The new notice keywords include ""Education,"" ""Lecture,"" ""Educational Support,"" and ""Mentoring.""

The user has frequently searched for ""Lecture"" and ""Education,"" which directly correlate with the keywords from the new notice.

Only ""education"" appears in both the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords, but it accounts for only 6 of the 50 search records. This limited overlap suggests that the user is not particularly engaged with the new topics presented in the announcement, as their focus on technology and professional development reflects a different area of interest. The absence of searches related to ""club,"" ""meeting,"" ""youth program,"" ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""volunteering"" reinforces that the user's interests do not align with this new information.

The user's interest in the keyword ""education"" is significant as they have searched for it 10 times, indicating a strong inclination towards this topic. Additionally, their 6 searches related to ""lecture"" further suggest that they may find the content of the new announcement appealing, especially since lectures are often tied to educational themes.

However, the lack of searches related to ""inquiry"" leaves some uncertainty about their interest in that specific aspect.

The frequency of 'education' in their search history suggests a strong interest in this topic. Even though 'employment' does not appear in the user's search history, the significant interest shown towards 'education' implies that they might have an inclination to explore employment opportunities, especially if they are linked to educational advancement.

However, the high frequency of ""COVID-19"" searches with no context toward the new announcement's keywords makes it difficult to ascertain their overall interest in the specific announcement about the contest and application period.

Since the user has shown some interest in keywords relevant to the announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that they might be somewhat interested in the new announcement, possibly leading to a target score of 1.

Given that the user has not searched for the keyword ""AI"" at all in their recent 50 searches, it appears that they may not have any interest in this specific notice. While the user's diverse interests in various fields are evident, the absence of any related searches for the new announcement indicates a lack of engagement or curiosity towards AI specifically.

Although ""AI"" is present in both the search history and the new notice keywords, the user has not shown significant interest in ""server"" or ""cloud,"" as there are no records of them searching for those terms.

However, the new notice's keywords are ""event"" and ""event.""

The user's search history shows that they searched for ""contest"" 17 times, ""company exploration"" 9 times, ""university job center"" 7 times, ""educational program"" 6 times, ""participant qualifications"" 6 times, and ""student participation"" 5 times.

Given that the keyword ""contest"" is heavily represented in the user's search history with 17 searches, it suggests that they have a significant interest in opportunities related to contests. The keyword ""planning,"" while not directly reflected in the user's search history, may still be relevant as they may be looking for contests to plan or participate in.

Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the user is likely interested in the new announcement, indicated by the target score of 1.",1

The user's notification search history reveals that they searched for ""Student Support"" 18 times, ""Contest"" 17 times, and ""Planning"" 15 times. Despite the absence of relevant keywords in the new announcement, the user's consistent searches for these categories suggest a potential inclination towards them. However, without matching keywords in the announcement, it remains uncertain whether the user will find the new information engaging or not, leading to a conclusion of 0 for their interest.",0

The user's search history reveals a strong interest in keywords such as AI (8 times), Cloud (6 times), and Server (6 times), indicating a clear engagement with topics related to technology and education. 

Although there are additional keywords in the new announcement that were not frequently searched, the presence of AI and Cloud, both of which are prominent in this user's records, suggests that the individual is likely to find the new announcement relevant.

Specifically, they have searched for ""career exploration"" 10 times, ""extracurricular programs"" 7 times, and ""university job center"" 7 times, among others.

Given that the keyword for the new announcement is ""event,"" which is not present in the user's recent searches, there is no direct indication that the user is interested in this type of information.

Given that the user has not searched for any keywords related to exhibition, festival, event, or activity, it seems clear that these new tags do not align with the user's interests.

The new notification has keywords 'Lecture', 'Mentoring', and 'Education'. The user has searched for 'Education' 7 times and 'Mentoring' 5 times, indicating a clear interest in these topics. Although 'Lecture' was only searched 5 times alongside 'Mentoring', the overall frequency of searches related to the keywords in the new notification suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement.

While the user has shown significant interest in ""credit exchange,"" their searches do not include the other two keywords present in the new announcement. This could suggest that the user might have an interest in the topic of ""credit exchange,"" but without more related search history for ""course registration"" and ""application qualification,"" it is unclear if they will be interested in the new announcement overall. Therefore, given the lack of relevance for the other keywords and considering the overall interest level reflected in their search history, it seems that they are likely not very interested in this particular announcement, resulting in a target score of 0.",0

Additionally, there are mentions of ""corporate exploration"" (9 times), ""university job center"" (7 times), ""educational program"" (6 times), ""participant qualifications"" (6 times), and ""student participation"" (5 times). 

The high frequency of searches for the ""contest"" tag suggests that the user has a strong interest in contests, making it likely that they would be interested in the new announcement regarding the contest. While ""planning"" does not appear explicitly in the user's search history, the context of contests within the realm of planning could still implicate some level of interest, particularly given the significant engagement with the contest-related content. However, the dominant focus on contests makes it clear that the user is likely to find the new announcement relevant. Thus, the target score indicating interest (1) is appropriately justified based on the search behavior.",1

However, the new notice does not contain any significant keywords.

Since the new notice lacks important keywords, it does not resonate with the user's recent search interests, which heavily revolve around themes related to education and career support. The absence of relevant tags from the new notice in conjunction with the user's comprehensive search history suggests that the user is unlikely to be interested in this notice, leading to the conclusion that their interest level is low.",0

The user's strong interest in ""education"" (11 times), ""lecture"" (7 times), and ""mentoring"" (5 times) suggests a notable inclination towards the subjects mentioned in the new announcement. Moreover, the presence of ""Ministry of Employment and Labor"" (3 times) aligns with the new keywords as well.

The user searched for ""design"" 10 times, which aligns with one of the key identifiers of the announcement. In addition, the user has also searched for ""education"" 7 times, which directly corresponds to another keyword of the announcement. 

Given the user's substantial search activity regarding both ""education"" and ""design,"" along with the occurrence of these keywords in the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely interested in the announcement.

Given that the target score is 0, it seems reasonable to conclude that the user likely does not have interest in the new announcement, as their search history does not align with the concepts presented in the announcement.

Given that the user has searched for various educational-related terms, it appears that their interests lean more towards specific fields of study, programming, and job-related services rather than general academic announcements. Thus, the lack of relevant searches for the new notice suggests that they are not likely interested in it, supporting the assigned goal score of 0.",0

Additionally, ""participant eligibility"" is somewhat related to the user's searches, even though it is not explicitly found in the records. 

Since the user has actively searched for the keyword ""contest"" many times, it suggests that they are likely interested in announcements related to contests. The presence of ""participant eligibility"" as a keyword in the new announcement may also resonate with them, linking their interest in contests to potential eligibility requirements.

The new announcement includes keywords related to contests (""공모전"") and application periods (""접수기간""). Since the user has actively searched for contest-related information 17 times, this indicates a clear interest in contests.

Given that the user has searched for educational and employment-related topics multiple times—such as ""education"" 8 times, ""registration method"" 6 times, and ""employment support"" 6 times—it suggests a strong inclination towards those subjects.

The absence of searches related to ""submission method"" may indicate that this aspect is less important to them. As the user is highly engaged with the keyword ""contest,"" which directly correlates with the new notice, it seems reasonable to conclude that they have an interest in the announcement.

Given that the user has not shown any interest in the keyword ""scholarship"" in their search history (as there are no instances of this specific tag being searched), it seems reasonable to conclude that the user is not interested in this announcement.

The user searched for the ""event"" tag 10 times, the ""marketing"" tag 9 times, while also showing considerable interest in labor ministry, education, and internship tags with 8 or 7 searches for each.

The new announcement's keywords include ""application guide,"" ""education,"" and ""employment."" Since the user has previously searched for ""education"" and ""employment"" tags 8 times each, this indicates a relevant interest in these areas. Thus, it can be inferred that the user is likely to be interested in the new announcement, particularly because both ""education"" and ""employment"" are present in their search history.

Overall, the combination of the user's high engagement with both ""education"" and ""employment"" and the relevant keywords in the new announcement suggests that the user is likely to find this information appealing, supporting a target score of 1 for interest.",1
1988,"Based on the given information, the new announcement contains the keywords: backend development, bootcamp, job support, lecture, mentoring, education, and backend. In the user's notice search history, the user has searched for the following tags: planning (9 times), lecture (8 times), design (8 times), mentoring (7 times), college student (6 times), 2024 academic year (4 times), contest (4 times), and education (4 times).

The keywords ""lecture,"" ""mentoring,"" and ""education"" from the new announcement closely align with the user's search history, as the user has actively searched for these topics. Specifically, the user has searched for ""lecture"" 8 times and ""mentoring"" 7 times, indicating a significant interest in these areas. Additionally, the user has searched for ""education"" 4 times, which further reinforces the likelihood of interest in educational-related content.

Given this strong correlation between the user's search history and the keywords of the new announcement, it is reasonable to conclude that the user is likely to be interested in this announcement, resulting in a target score of 1.",1
1989,"Based on the given information, the user's search history indicates that they have searched for various tags related to scholarships, eligibility, supporters, employment, free education, events, planning, target participants, and awards. However, the new announcement includes keywords namely ""educational course"" and ""event,"" which are not reflected in the user's search history.

Given that the user has not actively searched for topics directly linked to the keywords ""educational course"" and ""event,"" this suggests that the user may not have a particular interest in the new announcement. The absence of matching search tags makes it difficult to establish a connection between the user's previous interests and the new information provided.

Thus, considering the lack of relevant search history related to the new keywords, it appears that the user is not particularly interested in this announcement, which aligns with the target score of 0.",0
1990,"Based on the given information, the user's interest level can be assessed through the keywords of the new announcement and their recent search history. The new announcement has the keywords ""planning,"" ""competition,"" and ""inquiry."" In the user's search history, they have searched ""planning"" 8 times, ""competition"" 10 times, and there are no records for ""inquiry.""

The user's extensive search on ""competition"" and considerable interest in ""planning"" suggest a strong likelihood of interest in the new announcement. Both keywords align well with the tags the user has previously engaged with, especially since ""competition"" and ""planning"" are among their top interests based on the search counts. However, there is no evidence of searching for ""inquiry,"" which may indicate a lesser interest in that aspect of the announcement. 

Given this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the user has interest in the new announcement, reflected by the target score of 1.",1
1991,"Based on the given information, the user's search records show significant interest in specific topics, with 18 searches for ""contest,"" 11 for ""UCC,"" 7 for ""essay,"" 6 for ""submission period,"" 4 for ""credit exchange,"" and 4 for ""current student."" However, the new announcement's keywords are ""planning"" and ""design."" 

Since there are no overlapping keywords between the user's recent searches and the new announcement, it suggests that the user does not have a direct interest in the topics covered by the announcement. While the user has actively sought information related to contests and UCC, these categories are distinct from the concepts of planning and design. 

Thus, based on the lack of connection between the user's search history and the new announcement's keywords, it is logical to conclude that the user is unlikely to be interested in the new notice. This leads to the target score of 0, indicating no interest.",0
1992,"Based on the given information, the user has shown no specific interest in the keyword ""planning"" from the new notification, as none of the user's search history includes this keyword. The user's search history consists of various tags related to job application processes, qualifications, education, and recruitment announcements. This indicates that the user is focused on different aspects of job notifications rather than the planning keyword. Therefore, the goal score of 0 reflects that the user does not seem to have any interest in the new announcement related to planning.",0
1993,"Based on the given information, the user has shown a high level of interest in the topics reflected by their recent search history. The keywords associated with their search records include ""Youth"" (청년) searched 11 times, ""Education"" (교육) searched 10 times, ""Contest"" (공모전) searched 10 times, ""Application Period"" (접수기간) searched 10 times, and ""Planning"" (기획) searched 9 times. 

Looking at the new announcement's keyword information, which includes ""Planning"" (기획), ""Poster"" (포스터), and ""Contest"" (공모전), we can see that the user has specifically searched for ""Contest"" (공모전) 10 times. Additionally, the user has also searched for ""Planning"" (기획) 9 times. This suggests that the user is likely interested in the new announcement since both ""Planning"" (기획) and ""Contest"" (공모전) are directly relevant to their recent searches. 

While the keyword ""Poster"" (포스터) does not appear in the user's search history, the existing interest in the other two keywords strongly indicates that the user is inclined to find this new announcement relevant. Therefore, given the user's recent search behavior and the connection to the new keywords, the predicted target score would be 1, indicating the user is likely interested in the new announcement.",1
1994,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains the keywords ""contact information,"" ""credit exchange,"" ""course registration,"" and ""notes."" The user's search history indicates a strong interest in these topics, with the user searching for ""contact information"" 6 times, ""credit exchange"" 14 times, ""course registration"" 7 times, and ""notes"" 5 times. 

Considering that the user has frequently searched for these related tags, it suggests a clear interest in the content of the new notice. The overlap between the tags in the user's search history and those of the new notice indicates that the user is likely interested in the new notice, supporting a target score of 1.",1
1995,"Based on the given information, the new announcement includes keywords ""Planning"" and ""Poster."" However, looking at the user's search history, we can see that there is no record of these particular keywords being searched. The user has primarily focused on topics related to ""Backend,"" ""Employment,"" ""Cloud,"" and ""Programming Education,"" among others.

Considering that the user has not searched for any terms related to planning or posters, it appears that there may be little to no interest in this new announcement. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that the user is likely not interested in the announcement, which aligns with the target score of 0.",0
1996,"Based on the given information, the user has shown no interest in the new announcement. This conclusion is primarily derived from the absence of any significant overlap between the user's recent search history and the keywords of the new announcement. 

The user's search history indicates the following frequency of keyword searches: 5 times for AI, 4 times for online education, and a couple of times for security, among others. However, when we examine the new announcement's keywords—big data, server, Java, Python, security, government support, free education, AI, IT education, cloud, mentoring, employment linkage, and programming—we see that while ""security"" and ""AI"" are common between the two, they only account for a small fraction of the relevant keywords in the new announcement.

The keywords of the new announcement, particularly big data, server, Java, and Python, do not align closely with the user's recent searches, which suggests that while the user may have some interest in related fields (like AI), they are not actively seeking out the specific topics in this new announcement. Therefore, the lack of a higher frequency search for the critical keywords suggests the user is unlikely to be interested in this new announcement, leading to a goal score of 0.",0
1997,"Based on the given information, the target score indicates that the user is not interested in the new announcement (0). The new announcement does not contain any significant keywords, which makes it difficult to ascertain whether the user would have any interest in it. Furthermore, the user's recent search history indicates that they have searched specific tags such as ""education program"" (8 times), ""game"" (7 times), and ""employment support"" (6 times), among others.

However, since the announcement lacks relevant keywords, it's hard to connect the user's search history to this new notice meaningfully. Despite the user's activity on various tags, the absence of keywords in the new announcement suggests that the user likely does not relate their interests to this particular message. Hence, the evidence does not support a strong interest from the user toward the new announcement.",0
1998,"Based on the given information, the new notice contains no significant keywords. The user's notice search history reveals that they have searched for various tags, such as ""credit exchange"" 6 times, ""planning"" 6 times, ""backend"" 6 times, ""education"" 5 times, ""lecture"" 5 times, ""application qualifications"" 4 times, ""competition"" 4 times, ""event"" 4 times, ""2024 academic year"" 4 times, ""AI"" 3 times, and ""essay"" 3 times. 

Since there are no relevant keywords in the new notice, it's difficult to determine whether the user is interested in this notice or not. The absence of connection between the search history and the new notice's keywords suggests that the user's interest level is ambiguous, aligning with the goal score of 0, indicating a lack of interest.",0
1999,"Based on the given information, the user has a ""goal score"" of 0, indicating disinterest in the new announcement. The user's search history shows a significant focus on the following tags: ""competition"" (11 times), ""lecture"" (10 times), ""design"" (9 times), ""Korea Aerospace University"" (8 times), ""recruitment"" (6 times), and ""education"" (6 times).

The new announcement's keywords include ""student participation,"" ""educational course,"" ""Korea Aerospace University,"" ""education,"" ""student recruitment,"" and ""educational program."" Among these, ""Korea Aerospace University"" and ""education"" overlap with the user’s search history, but the frequency of searches for these specific tags does not indicate a strong interest in the new announcement's content. 

Despite the presence of some shared tags, the overall lack of a compelling focus on the new keywords suggests that the user is likely not particularly interested in this announcement, hence the score of 0. The user appears to have explored more specific topics related to competitions, lectures, and design rather than the broader themes presented in the new announcement.",0
